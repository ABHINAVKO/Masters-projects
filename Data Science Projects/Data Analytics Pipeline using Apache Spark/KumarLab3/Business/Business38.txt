Good morning.

Syria’s ever-more-brutal war, Poland’s fight over the future of Europe and the latest from the Olympics. Here’s the news: 

•  The Syrian government, with its Russian and Iranian allies, is fighting to regain control of western Syria, whatever the cost.

Violence that has been escalating over weeks hit a sudden peak. Syrian and Russian planes struck eastern Ghouta, a rebel-held enclave near Damascus, in one of the worst bombardments in years. At least 200 people, many of them children, were reported killed.

And Turkish jets and artillery attacked pro-government militias for a second day to keep them from reaching the northwestern city of Afrin to reinforce Kurdish militias.

The Syrian government’s support for the Kurds threatens to unravel months of diplomatic maneuvering by Russia and Iran.

• Poland broke international law by drastically increasing logging in the Bialowieza Forest, one of Europe’s last primeval woodlands, an advocate general of the European Court of Justice said. The court usually follows such conclusions in its rulings.

The fight over the forest, a new law about the Holocaust and changes to the judiciary are some examples of how the Polish government has defied Brussels, portraying itself to voters as a defender of national interests.

For the European Union, the stakes of this clash are higher than Brexit, our correspondents write. “The bloc faces a painful reckoning over whether, despite its efforts at discipline, it has enabled the antidemocratic drift, and what to do about it.”

• In Washington, President Trump ordered the Justice Department to propose regulations to ban so-called bump stocks, which can convert a semiautomatic gun into an automatic weapon.

There was another, smaller-scale indictment in the inquiry on Russian election interference: A Dutch lawyer who had worked with a former Trump campaign aide in Ukraine pleaded guilty to lying to investigators.

Nearly a dozen special elections are being held around the U.S. this year to fill seats suddenly left open by the #MeToo reckoning.

_____

• In Israel, the mushrooming corruption scandal plaguing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took a new turn.

One of his closest advisers was accused of trying to bribe a judge to drop a criminal investigation involving Mr. Netanyahu’s wife. The police arrested several of Mr. Netanyahu’s friends and confidants. Mr. Netanyahu could face charges of obstructing justice. (Here’s a more detailed rundown.)

Mr. Netanyahu called the accusations “hallucinatory” and “baseless.”

• At the Winter Olympics, Sofia Goggia is the first Italian to win gold in women’s downhill, followed by Ragnhild Mowinckel of Norway and Lindsey Vonn, the American skiing superstar.

Many snowboarders listen to music to boost their mood during competition. We asked some top athletes for their favorite tracks.

The unified Korean women’s hockey team closed out its Olympic run without a single win. For many, including our photographer Chang Lee, whose own life has been shaped by the division in Korea, that wasn’t the point. Check out his images of the Games.)

• In Italy, the electoral campaign slogans that warn against an “invasion” of migrants ignore the fact that the country’s social fabric has long been changing.

Our reporter returned to the Tuscan town where she grew up to see these changes in a place she knows all too well. In search of better lives, her classmates have moved away, and migrants have moved in.

(Meanwhile in France, the government is set to propose tougher immigration and asylum laws today.)

• “Equilibrium will soon be restored.” That was KFC, the fast-food chain, in Britain pledging to remedy shortages of chicken in its supply chain that disrupted one of its biggest markets.

Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.

• Beyond BFF. Many women are coining and co-opting new titles for their closest companions,  the author of a new book on friendship writes.

• In America, “these days, identifying as Muslim is more tricky than identifying as queer.” That’s Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, grandson and namesake of the Pakistani statesman, whose art explores his sexuality and religion.

• Scientists are racing to understand why immunotherapy drugs have worked for a few ovarian cancer patients when the medicines should have had no effect.

• An odd little museum exhibition in London traces the curious, double-edged life of scissors.

Gerald Holtom, the Briton who designed the peace symbol, was in “deep despair” when he created it on this day in 1958.

“I drew myself,” wrote Mr. Holtom, a World War II conscientious objector who was alarmed by the nuclear arms race. “The representative of an individual in despair, with hands palm outstretched outward and downward in the manner of Goya’s peasant before the firing squad.”

The symbol also combined the semaphores, or flag-signaling codes, for the letters “N” and “D,” or “Nuclear Disarmament.” The circle around it represented the earth.

Later that spring, the symbol appeared on buttons and signs in an antinuclear march to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, a warhead factory in Aldermaston, England. (The march became an annual event.)

The symbol, which isn’t trademarked, was embraced by the broader antiwar movement and disparaged by critics as anti-Christian.

Mr. Holtom is said to have later expressed a desire that the symbol be inverted so that it resembled hands reaching to the sky. Such a symbol, in addition to being more celebratory of peace, would also evoke the semaphore for the letter “U” — as in “Unilateral Disarmament.”

The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which still uses the symbol as its logo, is taking it on an anniversary tour around Britain this year.

Good morning. 

Here’s what you need to know:

• The mass shooting at a high school in Florida last week appears to be changing the nature of America’s gun-control debate.

Students are taking action: Dozens of students lay down in front of the White House on Monday, above. Survivors of the shooting are taking the long ride to the state capital, Tallahassee, to call for tighter gun-control laws. (Our reporter is tweeting from the bus.)

Teachers are grappling with the prospect of becoming first responders or, worse, human shields.

Our DealBook columnist has an idea. Some credit cards and payment services block certain purchases, so if lawmakers won’t limit guns, let banks do it.

• Russia’s bot army hasn’t stopped. 

Twitter accounts suspected of having links to Russia jumped on the hashtag #Parklandshooting right after the mass shooting last week, seeking to widen divisions on gun control.

President Trump continued his attempts to deflect blame for the Russian election interference detailed in U.S. indictments last week, suggesting that President Barack Obama was dismissive of the threat.

• The Syrian government, with its Russian and Iranian allies, is fighting to regain control of western Syria, whatever the cost.

Violence that has been escalating over weeks hit a sudden crescendo. Syrian and Russian planes struck a rebel-held enclave of some 400,000 people near Damascus in one of the worst bombardments in years. Nearly 100 people were reported killed.

And Turkish jets and artillery attacked pro-government militias for a second day, keep them from reaching the northwestern city of Afrin to reinforce Kurdish militias.

• A demographic time bomb.

South Korea’s fertility rate has plummeted to one of the lowest in the world. Add the country’s rising life expectancy, and South Korea is aging faster than any other advanced economy.

The economic fallout, as this essay for The Times Magazine points out, could be devastating.

South Korea and some other East Asian nations that need to replenish shrinking work forces — like Japan — may find their resistance to immigration unsustainable.

 Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching:

• Eric Schmidt is stepping down as executive chairman of Alphabet.

• Goldman continues to embrace Bitcoin.

• Boeing is circling Brazil’s Embraer.

• Apple is big, but just how big?

Want this in your own email inbox every morning? Here’s the sign-up.

In Eric Schmidt’s decade running Google, the company went from internet upstart to a tech giant. And as it did, Mr. Schmidt’s profile had grown and broadened. He gave speeches about the economy and cultivated government relationships.

But Google’s size and search dominance also raised concerns among lawmakers and regulators in both the United States and abroad.

So when Mr. Schmidt stepped aside as chief executive in 2011 and became executive chairman, one of his primary focuses was on government outreach. In the years since, he has hopscotched the world, developed close ties to lawmakers and served on White House advisory panels for the Obama administration.

Perhaps Google’s biggest victory during this time was its defeat of the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust probe. Officials for the agency had recommended in 2012 that the commission sue to challenge some of Google’s business practices, in what would have been the biggest antitrust case since the government sued Microsoft.

In early 2013, the five-member commission voted unanimously to end the probe after Google agreed to make some minor changes to its search practices.

That year Mr. Schmidt also famously traveled to North Korea with former Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico to tour the hub of North Korea’s computer industry.

In response to European regulators’ concerns about privacy, Google sent Mr. Schmidt and a team of executives on a tour of the continent in 2014 to explain Google’s stance on privacy.

Mr. Schmidt was also a supporter of Hillary Clinton’s most recent presidential run and was “ready to fund, advise recruit talent, etc,” according to the hacked emails of Clinton campaign officials that were released by Wikileaks.

But Mr. Schmidt’s influence in Washington has waned since President Trump was elected.

Mr. Schmidt joined Google in 2001 as chief executive to provide what amounted to adult supervision for the company’s young founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. He helped take the company public in 2004. A decade after taking the helm at Google he handed the reins of the company to Mr. Page and became executive chairman.

Mr. Schmidt will relinquish the executive chairman role at Alphabet’s next board meeting. He will continue to serve on the company’s board and will become a technical adviser to Alphabet. No reason was provided for the change. In a statement, Mr. Schmidt said that he, Mr. Page, Mr. Brin and Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, “believe that the time is right in Alphabet’s evolution for this transition.”

Goldman Sachs is positioning itself to become the first Wall Street firm to set up a cryptocurrency trading desk, Bloomberg reports. The firm aims to have the desk up and running by the end of June.

The Bloomberg article comes nearly three months after The Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman was “weighing a new trading operation dedicated to bitcoin and other digital currencies.”

Goldman has been more willing than its rivals to embrace digital currencies. It is one of the few Wall Street banks to clear bitcoin futures offered by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

Boeing has held takeover talks with Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer, a deal that would give Boeing a presence in the regional jet market, the WSJ reports. Shares of Embraer jumped more than 31 percent on the news. Boeing’s shares are down slightly on the day.

• Embraer has a market value of $3.7 billion as of Thursday morning. According to the WSJ, the two companies “have been discussing a deal that would involve a relatively large premium.”

• It’s far from certain the Brazilian government would sign off on a deal given that Embraer is “a crown-jewel of Brazilian industry.”

• A deal with Embraer would help Boeing counter Airbus’s plans to “take a majority stake in a joint venture with Bombardier that builds the single-aisle CSeries.”

• In a series of initial rulings over the last few months, the Commerce Department decided to levy duties of nearly 300 percent on the Bombardier CSeries, an early victory for Boeing that would increase the price of the rival plane in the United States.

A 55 percent surge in the tech giant’s stock has pushed Apple’s market value above $900 billion this fall. That’s a level no other American-listed company has hit. In fact, none have crossed $800 billion. Google-parent Alphabet has gotten the closet with a market capitalization of nearly $750 billion.

Yet a deeper historical look from the NYT’s Jeff Sommer and Karl Russell suggests that Apple’s market value, while still impressive, is not quite as spectacular.

• When adjusted for inflation, Apple’s market capitalization just recently surpassed Microsoft’s all-time high. At the heights of the dot-com bubble in 1999, Microsoft’s market capitalization peaked at $647 billion. In today’s dollars, that’s $901 billion. General Electric’s value in 2000 hits $848 billion when adjusted for inflation.

• By another measure, Apple’s size is even less impressive. Apple’s share of the total stock market doesn’t even rank in the top 20 going back to 1925. Consider that in May 1932, AT&T constituted 13 percent of the entire stock market — more than five times higher than Apple’s proportion today. In fact, Apple shares represented a larger share of the total stock market in September 2012 than they do now, 3.2 percent compared with 2.5 percent today.

Morgan Stanley made the tech giant its top stock pick for 2018. The reason? What it sees as Apple’s growing share of China’s smartphone market.

That goes against the recent trend, in which cheaper smartphone rivals have taken market share away from Apple in China.

Here’s a breakdown of Morgan Stanley’s key points (note that Morgan Stanley’s data is through Nov. 19, when iPhone X had been on sale for just 16 days.):

• “iPhone X adoption in China is on a faster pace than the iPhone 8 or 8 Plus.”

• “Significant pent-up demand” for iPhone upgrades “from the base of 2+-year-old iPhone owners”

• Apple has a 57 percent retention rate among iPhone users when they upgrade. That’s 20 percentage points higher than any other brand in China.

• Apple’s net switching rate, “or percentage of non-iPhone smartphone owners that switched to an iPhone minus the percentage of iPhone owners that switched away to a different smartphone brand,” increased in China to 9.2 percent during the four-weeks prior to Nov. 19.Only one other brand in China had a positive net switching rate over that period.

In conclusion: “Ultimately, these data points show that faster iPhone X penetration, coupled with increasing switching rates to Apple, have accelerated market share gains for the iPhone in China.”

Why is China important to Apple? IPhone sales accounted for more than 55 percent of Apple’s revenue last quarter, while Greater China accounted for nearly 20 percent of company’s sales. But Apple’s share of China’s smartphone market has been sliding, down to about 7 percent from an estimated 16.5 percent in late 2014.

Swiss financial watchdog FINMA said on Thursday the Swiss subsidiary of U.S. bank JPMorgan had committed serious anti-money laundering breaches in relation to Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB, Reuters reported.

From FINMA’s statement:

• “Enforcement proceedings conducted by FINMA between May 2016 and June 2017 uncovered serious shortcomings in the anti-money laundering controls of J.P. Morgan (Switzerland) Ltd in connection with business relationships and transactions associated with the allegedly corrupt Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB.”

• “The bank failed in particular to identify the money-laundering risks relating to cash flows between business accounts and personal accounts.”

• “In one case, it credited hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars from the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, allegedly earmarked for the purchase of a company, to the personal account of an individual with close ties to a 1MDB business partner.”

JPMorgan’s statement: 

• “The resolution announced by FINMA relates to matters that took place many years ago in the Swiss private bank, and since that time we have increased training, added staff and made improvements in monitoring and surveillance.”

FINMA, which did not impose monetary penalties on the bank, has appointed a monitor “to carry out an on-site review of the appropriateness and functioning of the bank’s controls and monitor them on an ongoing basis.”

When asked, Gary Cohn blamed unidentified lawmakers and a well-organized lobbying effort by the private equity industry. As it turns out, he wasn’t completely wrong, according to the WaPo.

Lobbyists for private equity, venture capital and real estate investors held weekly organization conference calls. Then they worked lawmakers.

More from Tory Newmyer of the WaPo:

Twenty-two lawmakers in the House — and the support of Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, who was a primary writer of the House legislation, was enough to potentially block that chamber’s bill.

In a surely coincidental series of announcements, several companies — including AT&T, Comcast, Wells Fargo, Fifth Third Bancorp and Boeing — announced that they were giving their employees bonuses or higher wages, and increasing investment in light of the passage of the Republican tax bill.

An aim of the tax bill is to help American companies, in the belief that they will in turn bolster the economy as a whole. (Justin Fox of Bloomberg View writes that AT&T’s bonuses aren’t a gimmick, but a natural consequence of a corporate tax cut.)

But skeptics have asserted that those companies really just want to get on President Trump’s good side. (AT&T, for example, is seeking approval for its Time Warner deal despite a lawsuit by the Justice Department. At a news conference, Mr. Trump praised AT&T’s bonus and capital investment plans.)

Some back-of-the-envelope calculations, courtesy of Binyamin Appelbaum of the NYT:

A bigger question: How long can any economic stimulus from the tax bill last?

From Patricia Cohen of the NYT:

The tax flyaround

• Expect more mergers next year, as clarity on tax policy settles in and penalties for selling businesses fall away, Aaron Back writes. (Heard on the Street)

• The tax overhaul doesn’t change the fact that automation will still cause job losses, and that giants like Apple and Alphabet will still pay lower taxes than nascent rivals, Farhad Manjoo writes in his latest State of the Art. (NYT)

• Highly indebted companies like Dell are still worried about the limits on deductions tied to corporate debt. (WSJ)

• Daniel Shaviro of N.Y.U.’s School of Law says of Mr. Trump, “I’m not even aware of a single provision in the bill that disadvantages him or his family, other than the change to state and local tax deductibility.” (WaPo)

The finding by the European Court of Justice that the ride-hailing giant is a transportation service instead of an online platform throws a hurdle into Uber’s expansion plan. The company won’t be kicked out of any countries, but the ruling does prevent the rollout of any services involving nonprofessional drivers — like UberPop (or UberX in the United States).

The decision comes as a group led by SoftBank is trying to buy out existing investors through a tender offer. Expect some negotiating between the two sides up until the last minute of the offer period, but SoftBank has gotten a bit more negotiating leverage thanks to the E.C.J.

Coming up fast in the rearview mirror: Didi Chuxing, Uber’s frenemy in China, has just raised $4 billion from SoftBank and the Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala. Uber is technically an investor in Didi now, thanks to a truce the two struck last year — but Didi is reportedly weighing an expansion into North America.

It’s time for some math

• Technically, Uber has retained its $68.5 billion valuation because SoftBank’s group has bought $1 billion of new shares at that level.

• But the SoftBank consortium is trying to buy out shareholders at a $48 billion valuation.

• Didi’s new fund-raising round values that company at $56 billion.

Extra credit: Uber has hired Barney Harford, the former C.E.O. of Orbitz, as its chief operating officer.

Sequoia, the hugely successful venture capital firm, is raising at least $5 billion for its next growth fund. That target is more than double the size of the V.C. firm’s last fund.

It appears to be a reflection of an increasingly clear fact: When SoftBank has almost $100 billion in its Vision Fund to invest — and can write a $250 million check in one go — more traditional players will be forced to react. One way is to try to go bigger.

As one unidentified V.C. investor told Kara Swisher of Recode:

A different approach: Remember when we reported earlier this week TPG Growth raised only slightly more money for its own new fund? Why not go whole hog? The fund’s managing partner, Bill McGlashan, told Michael: “It’d change the kind of companies we’d invest in.” (Translation: Trying to play in the Vision Fund’s kind of megadeals means taking bigger risks to make the kind of returns that the fund earns now.)

Penske — which already owns Variety, Deadline and WWD — has paid about $51 million for a majority stake in the onetime music industry touchstone. Rolling Stone was valued at about $100 million.

More from Sydney Ember of the NYT:

Whom Penske reportedly beat out: James Dolan of Madison Square Garden and the investment firm Rizvi Traverse, according to Variety.

Bitcoin is arguably in a bear market — because it has fallen 20 percent off its high point, which was set on Monday. But that hasn’t deterred some of Wall Street’s most sophisticated investors from wanting to dive into the world of digital currencies. (Why? Bitcoin is still up some 1,600 percent for the year.)

From Greg Zuckerman of the WSJ:

The ongoing tale of Bitcoin Cash: Coinbase is investigating claims of insider trading in the Bitcoin offshoot. After the exchange reopened trading in Bitcoin Cash, the digital currency fell, and as of this morning was trading at about $3,632.

The digital currency flyaround

• An unidentified trader has made a nearly $1 million bet that Bitcoin will reach $50,000 next year, using options. (WSJ)

• The founder of Litecoin, another digital currency, has sold his holdings. (Reddit)

Good morning.

The latest from the Winter Olympics, Iran’s secretive war in Syria and the resurgent popularity of opera music in Europe. Here’s the news:

• Curling, a sport not accustomed to high-profile controversy, has been rocked by a failed doping test by a Russian medal winner at the Winter Olympics.

The French ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron won silver a day after gracefully skating through a wardrobe malfunction.

And our Pyeongchang team looked at the German Olympians’ sport drink of choice: beer, of course (but nonalcoholic).

Here are the full Olympic medals table, results and schedule.

• Iran is training thousands of militiamen in Syria, in an effort to expand its network of militant proxies in the Middle East. (Above, satellite imagery of bases in Syria.)

Its goals, according to analysts, are changing the region’s strategic map and building a united front in a possible future war with Israel.

Our correspondent in the city of Kobani writes about how Kurdish fighters are using the veneration of the war dead as a potent recruiting tool.

(And in a not-very-subtle act of defiance, Turkey renamed the U.S. Embassy’s street in Ankara after its military offensive in Syria against Kurdish forces.)

• In Washington, the White House indicated that President Trump was open to supporting a bipartisan effort to revise federal background checks for prospective gun buyers in the wake of last week’s deadly shooting at a school in Florida.

Around the U.S., teachers are reflecting on whether they are prepared to take a bullet for their students. “I think about it all the time,” one said.

Social media bot swarms tied to Russia rushed to inflame the American debate on gun control.

But despite Mrs. Douglas’s warning that “There are no other Everglades in the world,” development has continued to encroach.

The school now in the news was named in her honor in 1990, commemorating her 100th birthday. She died eight years later, in the same Miami cottage in which she’d lived since 1926.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Soon after the mass shooting at a high school in Florida last week, Twitter accounts suspected of having links to Russia jumped on the hashtag #Parklandshooting, posting messages about gun control.

The automated accounts follow a pattern: “The bots focus on anything that is divisive for Americans. Almost systematically,” said an executive at a company that tracks online disinformation campaigns.

• The shooting, which killed 17 people, has left educators grappling with the prospect of becoming first responders or, worse, human shields. One teacher said, “If I go through my college transcripts — master’s degree, doctorate courses, all that — I know for sure there are no courses that say: ‘Shooter on Campus 101.’ ”

• At a time when Washington has shown little interest in limiting the sale of assault weapons, our DealBook columnist, Andrew Ross Sorkin, has an idea: Let banks do it.

He argues that credit card issuers, some of which already ban the purchase of legal products like virtual currencies, could easily gain more leverage over the gun industry than lawmakers have.

• President Trump is open to improvements in federal background checks for prospective gun buyers, the White House said on Monday. Such changes are the focus of proposed legislation that the National Rifle Association supports.

• In a nearly four-year war against rebels armed by Russia, Ukraine’s defense spending has soared, from around 2.5 percent of its gross domestic product in 2013 to more than 5 percent this year, when it will total around $6 billion.

But the money that has rejuvenated Ukraine’s military has opened avenues for the graft and cronyism that many see as the country’s biggest enemy.

• “It serves no purpose for Ukraine to fight for its body in Donbas if it loses its soul to corruption,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned last year, referring to regions seized by Russian-backed separatists.

• One tension at the heart of the Affordable Care Act is that, while it aims to provide health coverage for all, it is far more generous to the poor and near-poor than to the middle class.

President Trump’s efforts to undermine the law have helped deepen the resentment that many of those who don’t qualify for government assistance feel for those who do.

• Such feelings help explain why the only government programs with broad support are those that help everyone: Social Security and Medicare.

• Nearly 100 people, including children, have been killed in the worst bombardment in years of rebel-held suburbs east of Damascus, the capital.

The Syrian government and one of its major allies, Russia, have escalated an aerial campaign to subdue the area, eastern Ghouta.

• Residents described the events as an attack on civilians, but the government argues that those who remained there were being held as human shields.

• The U.S. tax overhaul  now has more supporters than opponents, buoying Republican hopes for elections this year.

• The case against Google: Critics say the search giant squelches competition. An essay for The Times Magazine examines whether government should intervene.

• Fox News is planning a streaming service for “superfans.” Focusing primarily on right-leaning commentary, it would be available without a cable package.

SAN FRANCISCO — In early September, Facebook revealed that it had identified about $100,000 in ads purchased on its social network by a Russian company linked to the Kremlin. Distributed between June 2015 and May of this year, the more than 3,000 ads added to evidence that Russia interfered with the 2016 presidential election.

Similar ad purchases by Russian agents were also uncovered on other internet services like Google and Twitter.

The online ads in question do not necessarily fit the traditional idea of advertising, and Facebook’s ads are particularly unusual.

Facebook’s primary ad system plugs straight into the Facebook News Feed, the stream of information that serves as the primary interface for the social network. This system was created to deliver ads that could grab your attention as effectively as what internet companies call “organic content” — posts from your friends and family and other entities you are connected to on Facebook.

Indeed, ads are often the same as organic content, just with money behind them. “There is an ad-selling mechanism, but the ad itself isn’t really an ad. It’s content,” said Ron Berman, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton business school who studies online advertising, including the Facebook ad system.

Facebook was part of a gradual but significant change in online advertising over the past decade. As more people have moved more of their online activity from PCs to mobile phones, the lines between ads and organic content have continued to blur, particularly on popular social networking service like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Mobile phones offer less room on their screens for ads. Usually, there is only space for a single column of information, and that must accommodate both ads and other content. The result is that ads have moved into a more prominent position.

Consider the Google search engine. If you type the word “Samsung” into Google on a laptop, a Samsung ad is likely to appear at the top of the screen, above the list of search results chosen by Google. But if you do the same thing on a typical smartphone, the ad is likely to take up the entire screen.

Responding to the screen limitations, Facebook went further. It  created a new ad system that made ads an integral part of the News Feed, which dominates the screen on mobile phones.

These are Facebook pages built by businesses and other organizations on the social network. Facebook allows businesses and other advertisers to serve pages straight into the News Feeds of people they had no other connection to, targeting their particular interests and behavior.

As these pages appear, people can comment on them and “like” them, just as they can with anything else that shows up in their feeds. And if people click the like button, these pages will continue to show up in their feeds — and the feeds of their Facebook “friends” — for free.

On Facebook, people describe themselves and leave all sorts of digital bread crumbs that show their interests. Then Facebook matches these with other data it collects.

Facebook’s ad system provides ways to target geographic locations, personal interests, characteristics and behavior, including activity on other internet services and even in physical stores. Advertisers can target people based on their political affiliation; how likely they are to engage with political content; whether they like to jog, hike or hunt; what kind of beer they like; and so on.

If advertisers provide a list for email addresses, Facebook can try to target the people those addresses belong to. It can also do what is called “look-alike matching.” In this case, Facebook’s algorithms serve ads to people believed to be similar to the people those addresses belong to.

Like Google and others, Facebook runs an instant digital auction for each ad placement, considering bid prices from many advertisers. An advertiser might bid $2 to place an ad in a particular situation. Then Facebook weighs these bids against how relevant the ad is to that situation. If an ad is relevant, the advertiser need not bid as high to win the auction.

Unlike similar services, Facebook does not just consider how relevant an ad is next to the other available ads. It considers how relevant an ad is next to all other content, and it chooses ads based on how well they compete for attention with organic posts.

Google says it runs separate teams and separate technology for organic content and ads. The algorithm for organic content does not consider ads, and vice versa.

Facebook’s arrangement is a little different because the ad auction considers organic content as well. Ads are also reviewed by a mix of algorithms and human moderators to determine if they are breaking company policies. Facebook recently said it would add 1,000 more human moderators to the team that reviews ads.

By the fall of 2015, the Facebook ad engine was also driving ads on Instagram, which the company had acquired three years earlier. Twitter works a bit differently from these services, but the dynamic is similar. Twitter ads are merely posts that business and others pay to place in the feeds of individuals who match certain criteria.

As all these companies point out, paid advertisements are labeled ads or “sponsored” or “promoted” content. Facebook executives add that ads also usually include some sort of call to action, such as “Liking” a page.

Rob Goldman, Facebook’s vice president of ads products, said in a statement that the people who manage content from regular users and people who manage ads coordinate their work but operate in separate organizations, with different goals and policies.

“Our goal is to make ads on Facebook just as useful and relevant as posts people see from friends and family,” Mr. Goldman said. “But we also want people to know when they’re looking at an ad, so we clearly label them as sponsored.”

But the line between ads and content has blurred in ways that may not be obvious. If you “like” an ad, for example, posts from the same account will turn up in your feed automatically, without paid promotion — and without the “sponsored” tags.

These posts are not just free advertising, Mr. Berman said, but also something that people see as more credible and that Facebook is more likely share in the feeds of these people’s “friends.” On a service like Facebook, the effect of an ad can extend well beyond what an advertiser paid for.

It’s not clear. Facebook said about 10 million people had seen the ads.

Mr. Berman said that published academic studies, including one of his own, indicated that people were more likely to share sensational content — content that generates an emotional response. That could include posts related to gun control, gay rights or race relations.

If an advertiser posts an ad that is widely shared, this is still more free advertising. And from the perspective of the Facebook ad engine, that is a relevant ad. This means the cost of the next ad goes down. And the cycle continues.

Apple reported record profit and sales, Amazon easily beat expectations, and Google-parent Alphabet posted a loss because of the new tax law.

Here’s a look at the numbers:

Apple

• $20.1 billion — Apple’s profit during the quarter, up 12 percent.

• $88.3 billion — Apple’s revenue for the quarter.

• $61.6 billion — Revenue from iPhone sales, up 13 percent from a year earlier.

• 77.3 million — The number of iPhones that Apple sold in the quarter, down 1 percent and below the 80.2 million analysts expected, according to Bloomberg.

• $796 -- The average sale price of an iPhone, according to Bloomberg.

• $60 billion to $62 billion — Apple's revenue guidance for the current quarter, well below analysts’ expectations of $65.9 billion.

• $285 billion — Apple’s big cash pile.

Critics Corner

Robert Cryan of Breakingviews:

Amazon

• $1.9 billion —the e-commerce giant’s fourth-quarter profit, more than double its profit from a year ago and the first time Amazon’s earnings have surpassed $1 billion in a quarter.

• $789 million —The boost to Amazon’s bottom line from a one-time tax benefit.

• $60.5 billion — Amazon’s revenue in the quarter, up 38 percent and above analysts’ estimates of $59.8 billion.

Critics corner

Robert Cryan of Breakingviews:

Alphabet

• $3.02 billion — The loss Alphabet reported for the fourth quarter.

• $9.9 billion — The hit Alphabet took to its earnings related to the new tax law.

• $32.32 billion — The search giant’s revenue for the quarter, up 27 percent from same period a year ago.

Critics corner

Jennifer Saba of Breakingviews:

More than a decade after Viacom and CBS split, the boards of the two companies have formed a special committee to evaluate a possible merger.

Why now

• Shari Redstone, who along with her father, Sumner Redstone, controls the two companies, is pushing for a deal.Her previous effort to combine the two companies in 2016 faltered over the concerns of CBS’ directors and CBS’s chief executive, Les Moonves. According to media reports, Mr. Moonves may be more open to a deal, though the WSJ reports that he remains wary.

• Walt Disney’s deal for much of 21st Century Fox late last year has sparked much strategic rethinking across the industry. Ms. Redstone believes that CBS and Viacom need greater scale to better compete with Disney, Netflix and Amazon.

Critics corner

Tara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Gadfly:

Belinda Johnson is moving up. Laurence Tosi is moving out. And don’t expect the company to go public this year.

What’s happening: Ms. Johnson, who’s currently the home-rental company’s chief business affairs and legal officer, will become its chief operating officer. Meanwhile, Mr. Tosi, who had been Airbnb’s chief financial officer since coming over from Blackstone, will leave the company to focus on his investment fund.

Airbnb has hired a search firm to find a new C.F.O. Ellie Mertz, the company’s head of global financial planning, will fill in that role on an interim basis.

Between the lines

• Ms. Johnson had been a rising star at Airbnb, often compared to Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg as the company’s business-minded grown-up in the room.

• Mr. Tosi had been increasingly at odds with Airbnb’s C.E.O., Brian Chesky, over strategy. (The Information covered their disputes — which were over both strategy and tactics — in great detail.)

The context 

Airbnb is heading ever so slowly toward an initial public offering. It hired Ken Chenault as its first outside director, for example, and promoting its most successful business mind to C.O.O. is another step in that direction. Still losing its C.F.O. — particularly one well versed in Wall Street — could set those plans back a bit.

The company line

Here’s Mr. Chesky on Ms. Johnson:

And here’s a statement from Eric Holder, the former U.S. Attorney General who has been advising the company on anti-discrimination policies:

And here’s Mr. Chesky on Mr. Tosi:

Some of the most consequential battles in the world of technology are playing out in Europe, where governments are cracking down on tech giants like Google and Facebook.

Facebook’s quarterly results, released Wednesday, provide crucial information for better understanding the balance of power between Silicon Valley titans and the democracies of Europe.

The results clearly showed the importance of the European market to Facebook’s future growth. The company’s average revenue per European user in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.86, well below the $26.76 that Facebook rakes in per user in the United States and Canada.

Facebook should be able to move that European number a lot higher in the coming years. Europe’s economy is only a bit smaller than the United States’, and the Continent contains prosperous nations whose citizens are just as addicted to social media as Americans. Indeed, Facebook has more daily active users in Europe than in the United States and Canada (277 million versus 184 million.) What is more, total European daily active users grew in the fourth quarter, while the United States and Canada number edged lower.

All this helps explain why the growth in European revenue per user, at nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter versus the year-earlier period, is significantly higher than the 35 percent rate for the United States and Canada.

What does this mean for Facebook as European countries introduce measures aimed at protecting their citizens that may go beyond what the company is used to in the United States?

Given how lucrative Europe is and will be to Facebook, it may be willing to spend what it takes to comply with new regulations, and even tolerate any inefficiencies the rules impose on its advertising business. Indeed, Facebook itself says it wants to make its network safer for users and democracies. But if there is any slip in that stance, Europe’s leaders, seeing how important their countries are to Facebook’s bottom line, arguably have considerable leverage to respond.

Its price on Thursday: $8,915

Its all-time high hit on Dec. 18: $19,511.

That’s more than a 50 percent slide, and it marks it lowest price since November. To put the Bitcoin’s recent slide in perspective, the cryptocurrency has lost $44 billion in market value last month, according to Bloomberg.

The tumble has continued so far in February. Bitcoin is down 11 percent Thursday.

Regulators are increasingly worried that Bitfinex, a widely used (and famously opaque) exchange, has been propping it up. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has subpoenaed the company, whose Tether digital token is often used to buy other virtual currencies.

More from Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:

Where we stand: According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is trading at $9,545, down almost 7 percent over the last 24 hours, Ethereum’s Ether at $1,099, and Ripple’s XRP at $1.05, down 7 percent.

The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, is reporting that Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and Google’s parent, Alphabet, are in talks to build a tech hub within the kingdom.

Details, including when and if a deal will come to fruition, remain scant at this point.

The context

Saudi Arabia is seeking to diversify its economy away from oil, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has made developing Saudi Arabia’s tech sector a key part of his “Vision 2030” plan. In late 2016, he traveled to Silicon Valley to promote those reforms, and the kingdom has taken bigger steps in recent years into the tech investing world.

That year Saudi Arabia poured $3.5 billion into Uber, and its Public Investment Fund put $45 billion into SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund, which is making eye-popping investments in tech companies.

An interesting point, from the WSJ article:

It isn’t clear how setting up tech hubs could fundamentally transform an oil company into a tech company — and therefore command a higher multiple — but it’d be interesting to see bankers make that argument.

— Stephen Grocer

The former G.E. chairman and C.E.O. will focus on tech and health care companies in his new role as a partner at N.E.A., one of the biggest V.C. firms in the world (that isn’t named SoftBank).

From the release:

and:

(Worth noting: Mr. Immelt’s successor at G.E. is struggling to turn that company around. See below.)

Mr. Immelt is only the latest corporate chieftain to find his next act in venture capital. Earlier this week, Ken Chenault announced that he would become chairman of General Catalyst Partners.

Mr. Immelt himself famously dallied with Silicon Valley last year, when he was in the running to become Uber’s next C.E.O.

The good news: Its fourth-quarter earnings handily beat expectations. The average price per ad went up 43 percent.

The possibly bad news: Mark Zuckerberg said changes to the News Feed had cut 50 million hours a day from the time users spent on it (as Shira Ovide of Gadfly points out, that’s about 2 minutes less each).

Here’s where our colleague Peter Eavis says investors should focus:

Today’s a big day for tech earnings

• Apple: Everyone wants to know how well the iPhone X has sold — well enough to start a new “supercycle”?

Steven Mnuchin urged lawmakers to do it quickly, amid worries that the government could run out of borrowing capacity late this month. (The Congressional Budget Office has changed its estimate because of the tax cuts.)

The Treasury secretary argued that the cuts would eventually pay for themselves, but conceded that it wouldn’t happen this year.

In the meantime, the Treasury Department said that the size of Treasury auctions will increase. And Republicans are increasingly split over whether to keep supporting short-term bills to keep the government operating.

Yesterday’s meeting, Janet Yellen’s last as Fed chairwoman, left rates unchanged. But the accompanying statement hinted that higher inflation — and rate hikes — might be around the corner.

Analysts’ takes:

• Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch write, “This shows that the Fed is taking notice of the recent shift in market perception about inflation.”

• Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics writes, “In short, the statement sets up the March hike, which will be followed by Jay Powell’s first press conference.”

• Diane Swonk of Grant Thornton said, “Everything from stronger growth at home and abroad to debt-financed tax cuts have raised expectations for inflation.”

Is the Golden State really a progressive utopia? Hardly, according to new research from the Advancement Project California, a Los Angeles-based civil rights group. In studying seven key quality of life issues: crime and justice, democracy, economic opportunity, education, healthy built environment, health care access and housing, researchers found significant markers of disparity in counties throughout the state.

The project maps out each issue for all of the state’s 58 counties and breaks each result down to the county level.

John Kim, the executive director of Advancement Project California, said the numbers prove just how much further the state has to go to help foster equality.

“We have some areas, like housing and economic development which are actually pretty good in terms of equality,” Mr. Kim said. “But these are problems throughout the state where you can really see how pronounced of a factor race is.”

Over all, and perhaps not surprisingly, the Bay Area is home to some of the most stubborn and dramatic gaps.

“Both because of the tech boom and because of the history of segregation there, we have it calcified,” Mr. Kim said. “It really gives lie to the notion that a rising tide will lift all boats.”

For decades the corner of North Shoreline and Space Park Way in the North Bayshore section of Mountain View was a sleepy area with an aging gym, a dive bar and several office buildings. Today, however, it has become a case study in the Bay Area’s booming tech industry and escalating housing crisis. Recreational vehicles line the area’s side streets. A nearby trailer park has filled up with tech employees, some of whom have Teslas parked in front of their modest, mobile homes.

David Boyer, a 46-year-old radio producer who lives in San Francisco, profiled the Mountain View area in his podcast, “The Intersection.” The Intersection — which looks at neighborhood change through the lens of a street corner — had three previous installments that focused on the Bayview, Tenderloin and Haight-Ashbury neighborhoods of San Francisco.

This time, Mr. Boyer said, he wanted to look at Silicon Valley, and found the juxtaposition of a trailer park and Google — which owns most of the land and office space in North Bayshore — to be an intriguing mix. Mr. Boyer spent a year interviewing residents and businesses in the area.

The podcast has six episodes that run about a half-hour each. They begin with the Silicon Valley’s agricultural past and progress through the growth of the tech industry to today’s questions about homelessness and how Mountain View is looking to transform its various office parks into a bustling urban neighborhood centered on Google. The podcast features mobile home residents, local business owners, Mountain View’s mayor and people who live in their cars. And while the voices of several Googlers can be heard, one group you will not hear from is the company’s corporate offices.
