Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• President Trump believes he has settled into the job enough to rely on his instincts rather than on the people who work for him, according to his friends and advisers.

That self-confidence surfaced over the weekend as Mr. Trump abandoned a strategy of showing deference to the special counsel examining Russian interference in the 2016 election. He criticized Robert Mueller and what he characterized as a partisan investigation, leading some Republicans to warn him against shutting down the inquiry.

The president also renewed attacks against former officials at the F.B.I., including “lying James Comey” and Andrew McCabe, whose firing Mr. Trump called “a great day for Democracy.”

• Unusually, they responded in kind: “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” Mr. Comey wrote on Twitter, apparently referring to his upcoming book. Others used far harsher language.

• Ever taken a quiz on Facebook?

The social network is again defending its protection of user information after a political data firm harvested private information from more than 50 million profiles. The data was obtained in 2014, when users were paid to take a personality quiz and download an app that scraped information from their profiles and those of their friends.

Lawmakers in the U.S. and Britain are calling for greater scrutiny after a joint examination published over the weekend by The New York Times and The Observer of London. The report explained how the firm, Cambridge Analytica, developed voter-profiling techniques that were used in Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.

• Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested, and the lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.

• Black men raised in the U.S., even in the wealthiest families, still earn less in adulthood than white men with similar backgrounds, according to a study that traced the lives of millions of children.

The review, led by researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, found that black and white women from families with comparable earnings had similar individual incomes.

• The research debunks  widely held hypotheses about income inequality.

• After Hurricane Harvey swamped the city in August, some residents learned that the flooding in their neighborhood wasn’t an accident.

Homes in Cinco Ranch sat on land that had been designed to flood, as part of a system to protect central Houston — a fact that wasn’t publicized when a developer was allowed to build there.

• Our video follows several families that learned their homes should never have been built in the first place.

• An American-educated economist is expected to become the next leader of China’s central bank.

The move comes days after Xi Jinping began a new term as president.

• Most Americans produce services, not stuff, a distinction that President Trump has ignored in talking about trade.

• Dropbox, the online file storage company, could go public this week. It’s one of the headlines to watch.

• U.S. stocks were up on Friday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today.

Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.

• How to stop eating sugar.

• Take some time and goof around this week.

• Recipe of the day: Start the week with a bright, flavorful corn salad with mint and feta.

• An explosion injured two people in Austin, Tex., hours after the authorities appealed to hear from whoever was responsible for several deadly package bombs in the city this month.

• Russian voters  gave President Vladimir Putin their resounding approval for a fourth term.

• Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to Saudi Arabia’s throne, begins a visit to the U.S. today. He discussed on “60 Minutes” where he hopes to take the kingdom.

At the same time, the Trump administration is trying to fend off an effort in Congress to halt U.S. military support to the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen.

• The N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament included upsets aplenty, with the elimination of five top seeds on Sunday. The University of Maryland, Baltimore County, also lost, after its unprecedented victory over the No. 1 seed Virginia in the first round.

In the women’s tournament, Tennessee was upset in the second round for the second straight year.

• “Black Panther” has made $605 million domestically, making it the second-fastest movie to reach $600 million, after “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

• Our reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones notes The Atlantic’s examination of “The Nancy Pelosi Problem,” especially its citation of research (pointed out by the Columbia psychologist Eric Schrimshaw) showing that people reacted positively when a fictional male senator was described as “ambitious” and with “a strong will to power” — but with “moral outrage” when the fictional senator was female.

• Kevin McKenna, one of our business editors, recommends this from StoryCorps, via NPR: “The son of an immigrant Pakistani taxi driver, Muhammad Faridi wound up a partner in a New York law firm. His roots embarrassed him as a young man, but now give him pride. A good read, and an even better listen.”

• Shining at South by Southwest

One of our critics lists 17 performances that stood out at the annual music festival.

• Robots in your role, if not your job

A business research organization recently predicted that about one-third of workers in the U.S. will have to switch occupations by 2030 because of automation.

We visited the (partially) automated future at a FedEx facility in North Carolina.

• Copy-edit this

• Quotation of the day

“If he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency, because we’re a rule-of-law nation.”

— Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, on suggestions that President Trump might fire the special counsel.

• The Times, in other words

Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles.

In March 1957, when Elvis Presley was 22, he purchased an opulent mansion in Memphis, called Graceland, for just over $100,000.

He was already a star, and at work on his second movie, “Loving You.”

The land had been owned for generations by the family of S. E. Toof, a newspaper publisher, and it was named after a female relative, Grace. Grace’s niece and her husband built the mansion in 1939.

Mr. Presley installed a pool with a jukebox nearby, hosted friends and relatives, and created a “Jungle Room” with green carpets and a Polynesian theme.

After struggling with ill health and prescription drug abuse, he died of a heart attack at Graceland on Aug. 16, 1977, and is buried there. He was 42. Read his Times obituary here.

Five years later, Graceland opened to the public and became one of the country’s most popular tourist destinations (the address is 3764 Elvis Presley Boulevard). Many visit yearly for the anniversary of his death.

Last year, just before the 40th anniversary, Graceland underwent a $140 million expansion, including a large hotel and entertainment complex. You can take a virtual tour here.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• More than a decade ago, Facebook opened itself to the world, inviting developers to build apps and programs on top of the social network’s platform.

Millions of third-party apps have been created since then, and the consequences of Facebook’s loose approach to the collection of user data are becoming clear, our tech columnist writes.

As Facebook grapples with questions about its role in the spread of disinformation, the company’s chief information security officer is said to be leaving. The executive, Alex Stamos, had pushed for more transparency but met resistance from other senior leaders, according to current and former employees.

• Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm that harvested information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles, also sought to entrap politicians with sex or bribes, according to an investigation in Britain that included a journalist posing as a prospective client.

• A male student opened fire at a high school in Southern Maryland today, injuring two students and exchanging gunfire with an officer at the school, the police said. The suspect was later confirmed dead.

• The shooting comes just over a month after 14 students and three adults were killed at a high school in Parkland, Fla.

• Last year, we wrote about how Arizona’s promise to keep the self-driving car industry free of regulations attracted dozens of companies, including Lyft, Uber and Waymo.

That lack of oversight is among the factors under scrutiny after an autonomous car operated by Uber  killed a woman in Tempe, Ariz. It is believed to be the first pedestrian death associated with self-driving technology on a public road.

• Supporters say the cars will ultimately be safer than regular vehicles because they take easily distracted humans out of the equation. But the relatively new technology is only starting to experience the unpredictable situations that drivers can face.

• The authorities are trying to determine whether a package that exploded early today at a FedEx distribution center near San Antonio was linked to four recent bombings in Austin.

The latest explosion, in Schertz, Tex., lightly injured one employee, law enforcement officials said. The package was addressed to an Austin destination, according to local news reports.

• A “serial bomber”  is being sought in Austin after a string of explosions that have killed two people and wounded four.

• For weeks, the international news media has shown images of wounded children and throngs of refugees fleeing the Syrian military’s offensive in a rebel-held suburb of Damascus.

This week, the government hit back with videos showing President Bashar al-Assad visiting the area to congratulate his forces and to greet cheering residents.

• Our correspondent reports: “Mr. Assad delivered an alternative view of the war, one in which he is assured and in charge, casually cruising past bombed-out buildings, often driving with just two fingers, an elbow propped casually out the window. It is a world in which his opponents are all terrorists and his troops all heroes.”

• The chaotic five-month effort to keep the Weinstein Company afloat has ended.

The Hollywood studio filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, and said it released anyone “who suffered or witnessed any form of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein” from nondisclosure agreements.

• Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, is facing requests from several countries for exemptions from steel and aluminum tariffs.

• After we published an article on tipping and the power imbalance it creates between customers and servers, hundreds of readers wrote in with their own experiences — on both sides of the equation.

• U.S. stocks were down on Monday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today.

Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.

• Fun fact: The shape of your ear affects the way you hear.

• Why it’s so hard to invest with a social conscience.

• Recipe of the day: Fried chicken on a weeknight? Yes, you can.

• “You don’t have to be tech savvy to understand how much information Facebook has about you, everything you like, everything you share, and everyone you know. This BuzzFeed piece is a fast, easy primer, with a headline that says it all: ‘3 Simple Ways We Give Up a Ton of Very Personal Information to Facebook and Random Apps.’ ” — Alan Henry, Smarter Living editor

• “How does it feel to be a problem?” W. E. B. Du Bois asked. Our briefings and What We’re Reading editor, Andrea Kannapell, recommends The Atlantic’s revival of the civil rights activist’s meditations on the question in 1897. (The animation is accompanied by a computer voice that, strangely, adds to its eloquence.)

• Warning before ambush in Niger

The leader of an ill-fated team of American soldiers had said they were unprepared to carry out a mission that turned into a deadly ambush last fall, according to preliminary findings of a Defense Department investigation.

• Back to the Caribbean

Six months on, how are the islands recovering from the devastation wrought by Hurricanes Irma and Maria?

To find out, our Travel writers spent time in Dominica, St. John, St. Martin and Puerto Rico, including San Juan.

• Subway gets a flunking grade

New York City’s system slid to a new low point in January, with just 58.1 percent of all weekday trains arriving at stations on time.

• Women’s N.C.A.A. basketball 

Central Michigan, a No. 11 seed, stunned No. 3 Ohio State to earn a first trip to the round of 16. Here are Monday’s scores.

• Best of late-night TV

Stephen Colbert reacted to the news that 50 million Facebook users weren’t notified that their personal information had been retrieved by a political-data firm: “Really? The one time I actually would have wanted a Facebook alert.”

• Quotation of the day

“Tuberculosis is the shadow of misery. If there’s a disease that is a marker of poverty, it’s tuberculosis.”

— Dr. José Félix Oletta, a former health minister in Venezuela, on the disease’s aggressive comeback in the country.

• The Times, in other words

Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles.

Today, we end with a note from the departing writer of our European briefing, Patrick Boehler:

Since the European briefings’ inception over a year ago, this has been the question I have been asked the most: “How do you know what Europeans want to read?”

That’s a fair question for a journalist, albeit a European one, who has spent most of his adult life in Asia, and still is there.

It is also a legitimate question for a U.S. newspaper at a time in which American news cycles are focused on the twists and turns of a tumultuous presidency.

So, here’s what we do:

Every day, we spend hours poring over correspondents’ dispatches and news reports from across Europe, from Iceland to Turkey.

In conversations with editors, we seek to distill wider trends from the day-to-day politics and give you what you need to know to start your day.

Of course, the result has often been a compromise. Is it flawed? Always.

But that’s the rule for all early drafts of history.

My last briefing is today’s. I’d like to invite you to keep reading, keep debating and keep challenging assumptions. Thank you for your time! Now enjoy your morning coffee.

SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook has introduced sweeping changes to the kinds of posts, videos and photos that its more than two billion members will see most often, saying on Thursday that it would prioritize what their friends and family share and comment on while de-emphasizing content from publishers and brands.

The shift is the most significant overhaul in years to Facebook’s News Feed, the cascading screen of content that people see when they log into the social network. Over the next few weeks, users will begin seeing fewer viral videos and news articles shared by media companies. Instead, Facebook will highlight posts that friends have interacted with — for example, a photo of your dog or a status update that many of them have commented on or liked.

The changes are intended to maximize the amount of content with “meaningful interaction” that people consume on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, said in an interview. Facebook, he said, had closely studied what kinds of posts had stressed or harmed users. The social network wants to reduce what Mr. Zuckerberg called “passive content” — videos and articles that ask little more of the viewer than to sit back and watch or read — so that users’ time on the site was well spent.

“We want to make sure that our products are not just fun, but are good for people,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “We need to refocus the system.”

Thursday’s changes raise questions of whether people may end up seeing more content that reinforces their own ideologies if they end up frequently interacting with posts and videos that reflect the similar views of their friends or family. And bogus news may still spread — if a relative or friend posts a link with an inaccurate news article that is widely commented on, that post will be prominently displayed.

The goal of the overhaul, ultimately, is for something less quantifiable that may be difficult to achieve: Facebook wants people to feel positive, rather than negative, after visiting.

“When people are engaging with people they’re close to, it’s more meaningful, more fulfilling,” said David Ginsberg, director of research at Facebook. “It’s good for your well-being.”

Facebook has been under fire for months over what it shows people and whether its site has negatively influenced millions of its users. The company has been dogged by questions about how its algorithms may have prioritized misleading news and misinformation in News Feeds, influencing the 2016 American presidential election as well as political discourse in many countries. Last year, Facebook disclosed that Russian agents had used the social network to spread divisive and inflammatory posts and ads to polarize the American electorate.

Those issues have landed Facebook in front of lawmakers, who have grilled the company about its influence last year. Next Wednesday, Facebook is set to appear at another hearing on Capitol Hill, along with Twitter and YouTube, about the online spread of extremist propaganda.

The repercussions from Facebook’s new News Feed changes will almost certainly be far-reaching. Publishers, nonprofits, small business and many other groups rely on the social network to reach people, so de-emphasizing their posts will most likely hurt them. Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management at Facebook, who is responsible for running the News Feed, acknowledged that “there will be anxiety” from partners and publishers who often complain about the constant changes in what will be shown across the network.

The change may also work against Facebook’s immediate business interests. The company has long pushed users to spend more time on the social network. With different, less viral types of content surfacing more often, people could end up spending their time elsewhere. Mr. Zuckerberg said that was in fact Facebook’s expectation, but that if people end up feeling better about using the social network, the business will ultimately benefit.

Changes to Facebook’s News Feed are not new. The Silicon Valley company constantly experiments with what shows up in the News Feed, and in the past it has also said it would prioritize posts from users’ friends and family. But Thursday’s shift goes beyond previous changes by prioritizing posts that have generated substantive interactions. A long comment on a family member’s photo, for instance, might be highlighted in the News Feed above a video that has fewer comments or interactions between people.

Facebook has conducted research and worked with outside academics for months to examine the effects that its service has on people. The work was spurred by criticism from politicians, academics, the media and others that Facebook had not adequately considered its responsibility for what it shows its users.

After the 2016 election, for instance, Mr. Zuckerberg initially shrugged off qualms about Facebook’s effect on the outcome, even as outsiders pointed to the proliferation of fake news stories on the site that had attacked Hillary Clinton. Mr. Zuckerberg later said he had been too hasty and dismissive of the concerns. More recently, he began signaling that Facebook was rethinking what it shows people on the site.

Last week, he posted on Facebook about his goals for 2018, including “making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent” and adding that “this will be a serious year of self-improvement and I’m looking forward to learning from working to fix our issues together.”

On Thursday, he said many of the discussions about Facebook’s responsibilities had prompted the company “to get a better handle on some of the negative things that could happen in the system.”

“Just because a tool can be used for good and bad, that doesn’t make the tool bad — it just means you need to understand what the negative is so that you can mitigate it,” he said.

Facebook and other researchers have particularly homed in on passive content. In surveys of Facebook users, people said they felt the site had shifted too far away from friends and family-related content, especially amid a swell of outside posts from brands, publishers and media companies.

“This big wave of public content has really made us reflect: What are we really here to do?” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “If what we’re here to do is help people build relationships, then we need to adjust.”

Mr. Zuckerberg said he was now focusing his company around the new approach. Product managers are being asked to “facilitate the most meaningful interactions between people,” rather than the previous mandate of helping people find the most meaningful content, he said.

Mr. Zuckerberg added that his way of running Facebook has shifted since the birth of his two daughters, Maxima and August, in recent years. He said he had rethought the way he views his and Facebook’s legacy, even if it will cost the company in the short term.

“It’s important to me that when Max and August grow up that they feel like what their father built was good for the world,” Mr. Zuckerberg said.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, made a surprise trip this week to meet with President Xi Jinping of China, Mr. Kim’s first trip abroad since taking power in 2011.

Mr. Kim is preparing for summit meetings with U.S. and South Korean leaders, and the visit suggests that he values or needs China’s approval — and possibly advice — before the talks.

New satellite images suggest that North Korea is expanding its nuclear production capabilities, which could complicate President Trump’s efforts to persuade Pyongyang to give up its weapons.

• The U.S. and South Korea are to announce a bilateral trade agreement today. It’s the type of deal that Mr. Trump says benefits American workers, but it may have more to do with geopolitical realities.

• Fearing an undercount, at least a dozen states signaled on Tuesday that they would sue to block the Trump administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census.

Opponents say the question would dissuade noncitizens, and even legal immigrants, from answering. The Trump administration says it’s needed for accurate estimates of voter numbers.

The Constitution requires that all residents of the U.S. be counted, whether or not they’re citizens.

• Here’s why  an accurate count is important.

• Christopher Wylie was “like a pink-haired, nose-ringed oracle sent from the future to explain data” when he testified before British lawmakers on Tuesday, our correspondent writes.

Mr. Wylie, the 28-year-old whistle-blower and co-founder of the political data firm Cambridge Analytica, described how personal information about 50 million Facebook users was harvested.

He also said that his firm had received help from at least one employee of the defense contractor Palantir Technologies. Palantir was co-founded by Peter Thiel, a Facebook board member and supporter of President Trump.

• Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, is said to have agreed to testify in at least one congressional hearing over the social network’s handling of user data.

• It’s the latest example of how rarely law enforcement officers are prosecuted for violence against suspects.

A pair of white police officers in Baton Rouge, La., will not be prosecuted by the state authorities over the fatal shooting of a black man, Alton Sterling, almost two years ago. Last year, the Justice Department also declined to bring charges in the case.

• Separately on Tuesday, hundreds of demonstrators filled Sacramento City Hall to protest the death of Stephon Clark, an unarmed black man who was fatally shot by two officers last week.

• Last week, we wrote about a major study of income inequality, focusing on how black boys and white boys raised in wealthy families fare as adults.

Here are income mobility charts for other groups, and a tool to make your own comparisons.

• Uber says it won’t  renew its permit to test self-driving cars in California until the end of an investigation into how one of its autonomous vehicles killed a woman in Arizona.

Arizona’s governor ordered the company to suspend  tests there.

• The fashion giant H&M has a problem: $4.3 billion worth of unsold clothes.

• U.S. markets fell on Tuesday, led by tech stocks. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today.

Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.

• Determine whether your sickness is contagious.

• Here’s how to decide if you should tell your boss about your mental illness.

• Recipe of the day: Bake a lemon tart with a filling that’s somewhere between a custard and a pudding.

Our journalists recommend these great pieces:

“Facebook’s data laxity, piggybacked on the general theme of fake news, has turned my field — social media — into the topic of the moment. This piece offers a look from the ground up at what exactly social media is, by going inside one of my favorite platforms, Reddit.” [The New Yorker]

— Nancy Wartik, Reader Center

“Adam Roberts died in January 2016 where he felt most alive: on the ski slopes of the Pacific Northwest. He was buried in an avalanche, an end that friends and even family felt he had courted. This is a story about skiing, and about a gifted and charismatic athlete who had a shot at professional status — but it’s really about ‘the blast zone of mental illness,’ which radiates out into so many lives.” [Outside]

— John Schwartz, climate change reporter

• New lessons from King’s death

The 50th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is next week. An exhibition at the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis compares contemporary events with the demonstrations he led.

We’d also like to hear what his assassination means to you.

• A former justice speaks

In an Op-Ed, the retired Supreme Court justice John Paul Stevens argues that the Second Amendment needs to be repealed.

• Tasty, whatever the category

It’s hard to say what kind of food Chez Ma Tante in Brooklyn serves, apart from the consistently good kind, our restaurant critic writes.

• “Roseanne” is back

The ’90s sitcom returned to ABC on Tuesday, and the reboot “has the potential to do something a little deeper and more ambitious than your average nostalgia-fest,” our chief TV critic writes.

We spoke with Roseanne Barr, who, like her character on the show, supports President Trump.

If you prefer a dash of espionage, we also reviewed tonight’s premiere of the final season of “The Americans.”

• Best of late-night TV

Trevor Noah was worried about a comment by John Bolton, President Trump’s nominee for national security adviser: “ ‘The earlier you strike, the more damage you can do:’ I think that’s a horrible strategy for keeping peace in the world. Although it is a great strategy for tackling an all-you-can-eat buffet.”

• Quotation of the day

“I no longer have a family. The ruling regime is guilty. Every bureaucrat dreams of stealing like Putin. Every state functionary treats people like garbage.”

— Igor Vostrikov, whose wife, three children and sister were among dozens who died in a fire at a mall in Siberia. 

• The Times, in other words

Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles.

Each week, The Times’s crossword column, Wordplay, highlights the answer to one of the most difficult clues from the previous week’s puzzles.

This week’s word: torii.

Torii (pronounced TOR-ee-ee) are familiar as a symbol of Japan, but many solvers were unsure of the word when it appeared in the March 20 puzzle with the clue “Traditional Japanese gate.” It has appeared 63 times in Times crosswords.

The gates, which have a traditional shape and structure, are closely related to the Shinto religion. Typically located at the entrance of shrines or in spots that hold special religious significance, they signal a transition from the profane world to the sacred. By walking through the torii, one has entered the world of the Kami, or Shinto gods.

The earliest documentation of the torii in Japan dates to 922, during the Heian period.

The structure of the torii varies, but the most important parts are the pillars (hashira), the lintel placed on the two pillars (kasagi) and a tie-beam that keeps the structure together (nuki).

For the easier puzzles at the beginning of the week, the word might appear with the clue: “Shinto temple gateway” or “Shinto gateway.”

Later in the week, it might be referred to as: “Shinto shrine entrance,” “Traditional Japantown feature,” “Decorative gateway in Japan” or “Japanese portal.”
