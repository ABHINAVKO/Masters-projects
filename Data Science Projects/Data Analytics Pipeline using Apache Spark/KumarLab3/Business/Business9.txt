['Selling Girl Scout cookies is meant to accomplish more than just distributing Samoas and Thin Mints to the world. Ideally, the girls would learn about setting goals, teamwork, money management and communicating with adults, among other things.', 'If the girls can develop some business acumen, all the better. And one young scout in San Diego has received nationwide plaudits for her shrewd entrepreneurial sense, setting up shop last week outside a marijuana dispensary.', 'The girl, who has not been publicly identified, sold more than 300 boxes in six hours, her father told ABC 10. Boxes now sell for as much as $5 in parts of the country, so she probably raised more than $1,500. Yes, theres money in the munchies.', 'While some have praised the plucky scout for figuring out where the demand would probably be, the Girl Scouts organization has been wrestling with how to handle marijuana-adjacent sales as more states have legalized the drug.', 'Girls who wheel carts full of cookies are generally free to travel where they please with their parents, even if that path takes them past marijuana shops, but there are often stricter rules around where to set up booths or stands. There are no nationwide policies related to marijuana dispensaries. Each local organization sets its own policies.', 'This is kind of a community issue, said Mike Lopes, a spokesman for the Girl Scouts of the USA. For the most part, its not any different than selling in front of any other kind of shop. It just happens to be a marijuana dispensary.', 'The girl in San Diego was selling her cookies outside an Urbn Leaf store, which posted a photo of her on its Instagram account.', 'We were definitely surprised by the controversy this created, Will Senn, the founder of Urbn Leaf, said in an email.', 'We all love Girl Scout cookies and thought a well-intended, lighthearted post to our social media accounts would be a little way to show our support, Mr. Senn added. While some have come out against her efforts due to the sales being made near a cannabis dispensary, there has been an outpouring of support from the public nationwide for this young entrepreneur and her creative marketing strategies. Why wouldnt we support a local girls fund-raising activities?', 'The San Diego scout isnt the first girl to anticipate munchies outside a marijuana distributor. In 2014, a 13-year-old sold 117 boxes in two hours outside a medical marijuana clinic in San Francisco.', 'The Girl Scouts of Colorado said in 2014 that it did not allow scouts to sell cookies in front of marijuana shops, liquor stores or bars. But it has since abandoned that policy, AnneMarie Harper, a spokeswoman for the Colorado organization, said in an interview on Wednesday.', 'Back then it was a blanket: No, you may not, she said. Now, its more of: Come to us, tell us where you want to be and what you want to do, making sure were checking off all of the safety guidelines.', 'When girls in the Colorado organization want to set up a booth, they are required to have the location approved first, Ms. Harper said. The organization vets locations for safety and legal issues, making sure they have permission from businesses and property management companies.', 'Some girls have sold near breweries, she said, but she wasnt aware of anyone trying to stake out a spot near legal marijuana sellers.', 'We really want girls to be cookie entrepreneurs, to find new and creative ways to reach customers, she said.', 'William W.

He was 80.', 'His wife, Ann Dean Bain, said the cause was complications of Alzheimers disease.', 'A native Tennessean who started his professional life as a development officer at his alma mater, Vanderbilt University, Mr. Bain at first seemed an unlikely candidate for the role of chief executive. Nevertheless, he made Bain & Company a fearsome competitor to McKinsey & Company, the Boston Consulting Group and Booz-Allen Hamilton. Along the way, he opened a venture capital firm, Bain Capital, which remains a leader in its field.', 'The Boston-based Bain & Company worked with some of the biggest companies in the United States, among them Texas Instruments, Black & Decker, Monsanto and Wells Fargo.', 'Chief executives have come to the very strong feeling that a small number of decisions, regarding a small percentage of policies they deal with, in the end determine 90 percent of their success or failure, Mr. Bain said in a 1979 interview with The New York Times. They are swamped with studies and information.', 'Corporate strategy, he added, in a pitch for his own line of work, allows them to isolate the small numbers of decisions that are going to have an impact. This makes it possible to manage big diversified companies.', 'Bain & Company at one point said that for every dollar it charged a client, it increased that clients profits by a factor of five to 10.', 'William Worthington Bain Jr. was born on July 30, 1937, in Johnson City, Tenn., to William Bain and the former Ruby Cloyd. He attended East Tennessee State University for two years before transferring to Vanderbilt and graduating in 1959 with a degree in history.', 'He was working as Vanderbilts director of development when Bruce Henderson, a fellow alumnus who had been impressed with Mr. Bains success in raising money for the school, made a compelling offer: to join his own young company, the Boston Consulting Group. Mr. Bain accepted and moved from Nashville to Boston.', 'Once there, he quickly advanced, generating big revenues and earning respect from the firms clients.', 'He founded his own company in 1973. Before long, he was poaching both clients and talent from his old firm. It was war, Mr. Henderson later said in an interview.', 'Mr. Romney was one of Mr. Bains most significant hires. Mr. Romney, a future governor of Massachusetts and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, joined Bain & Company from the Boston Consulting Group in 1977. A recent graduate of the Harvard Business School, where he had been at the top of his class, Mr. Romney later helped found Bain Capital, where he was managing general partner.', 'Its hard for me to imagine my life and career without Bill Bains mentoring, Mr. Romney said in a statement after Mr. Bains death. He hired me, taught me, and gave me the opportunity of a lifetime. His vision and confidence made Bain Capital possible.', 'During his unsuccessful campaign to deny President Barack Obama a second term, Mr. Romney fell under criticism for using controversial tax-avoidance strategies on certain investments that he still held through Bain Capital.', 'A father of four, Mr. Bain set a work schedule for himself that enabled him to arrive home in time to read bedtime stories (and often to catch Cheers on TV). As coach of his childrens Little League teams, his son Alexander remembered, he occasionally arrived on the field at the last minute, still wearing his pinstriped suit.', 'By the early 1990s, Mr. Bain had stepped away from his management role. He proceeded to found a small private-equity investment firm, Bain Willard Companies, with Ralph R. Willard, under which he became an owner and director of a yacht-building company.', 'In addition to his wife and his son Alexander, Mr. Bain is survived by three other children, William, Adam and Samantha; three grandchildren; and a brother, Larry.', 'A genre exercise, the detective movie Small Town Crime relies on the usual time-tested ingredients: the boozy loner lawman, the beautiful female victim and the reliably mysterious, invariably competent villains. The directors and brothers Eshom Nelms and Ian Nelms have obviously made a study of the genre, both in its old and more recent iterations, and while theyre happy to play around with the form, they pretty much leave the basics intact. By far their smartest, most inspired move is to have cleared room for John Hawkes, one of those actors who are more often seen nibbling at the edges of a scene, leaving perfect little teeth marks that sometimes give a movie its primary texture.', 'Mr. Hawkes plays Mike Kendall, a former cop. He lives alone in a Utah town in nice house with a white picket fence that hes flattened, doubtless after a hard night. Hes halfheartedly looking for work, but all he seems to want to do is drink and pal around with his brother-in-law (Anthony Anderson). So Mike drinks and drinks some more, tossing back beer until he staggers, stumbles and blacks out. He doesnt seem otherwise affected by his prodigious consumption and, for some reason, the filmmakers seem amused by it. He looks healthy enough, even when lifting weights between sips.', 'One morning, Mike finds a badly beaten woman (Stefania Barr) near a field that hes slept in after another soused night. Shes an enigma and soon his possible redemption, a sacrifice to the story gods that lets him play lawman again. With a cheap business card and an equally cheap jacket and tie, he smilingly ambles it into the shamus role, knocking on doors and sniffing out leads among all the yammer and serviceable visuals. Before long he is chasing down a familiar dark tale of very young women and very bad men, and trading patter with both a silky rich cat (Robert Forster) and a smooth pimp (Clifton Collins Jr.), who rolls up with a scowl, pummeling first, asking questions later.', 'The supporting players slide into their types just fine, though for the most part they remain little more than satellites orbiting Mike or, rather, Mr. Hawkes. Even Octavia Spencer, who plays Mikes sister and, as a performer, can overpower her scenes, never manages to wrest even the tiniest corner from Mr. Hawkess firmly relaxed grip. The Nelmses dont make enough of their more intriguing ideas (Mikes familial history) and end up right where you expect they would, bang bang. But Mr. Hawkes keeps you tethered, whether hes navigating the movies uneven tones or peeling down one of cinemas lonely highways in a muscle car so lovingly shot it deserves a co-star credit.', 'Hurricane Irma began to wane Monday, moving north as a tropical storm after tearing through the Caribbean and South Florida, leaving homes and businesses in disarray.', 'Tyson Foods closed four chicken and beef processing plants in Florida and Georgia on Monday in anticipation of the winds and rain, said Derek Burleson, a spokesman for the company.

Its stock had dropped 15 percent on Thursday, then regained some of that ground Friday.', 'The big national carriers like State Farm and Allstate cut back on writing homeowners insurance in Florida years ago, citing catastrophic risks and unhelpful state regulators. Those reductions left a vacuum filled by one state-owned insurer and dozens of relatively little-known companies, like Universal, that do all or most of their business in the state.', 'Insurer strength could be more of an issue in Florida than it was with Hurricane Harvey in Texas, where most of the damage was from flooding, a peril covered by the federal government.

How the gap is calculated may not be intuitively obvious, though.', 'One set of returns is straightforward: It is based on prices at the start of trading in New York at 9:30 a.m. to the market close at 4 p.m. The second set is, essentially, the reverse: It is price returns from the 4 p.m. close to the market opening at 9:30 a.m. the following day.', 'Because stock prices at the market open tend to be higher than the price at the previous days close, you dont actually have to stay up all night and trade on an electronic network to rack up overnight gains. Simply holding shares while you sleep will do it. So for buy-and-hold investors, these findings are particularly encouraging: Get your rest, ignore the temptation to trade and you can do just fine.', 'The new Bespoke analysis focuses on the returns of the first exchange-traded fund in the United States: the SPY or SPDR S&P 500 E.T.F., which started trading on Jan. 29, 1993. That E.T.F. mirrors the Standard & Poors 500-stock index, which often serves as a proxy for the entire stock market (though it actually represents only 500 of the biggest companies).', 'The SPYs overall price gain from its inception through January has been stupendous: 541 percent cumulatively, not counting dividends, Bespoke says.', 'But look more closely, as Bespoke did, and a remarkable fact emerges.', 'Separate the daytime and the after-hour returns and calculate them cumulatively, as Bespoke has done, and it turns out that all of that price gain since 1993 has come outside regular trading hours.', 'If you had bought the SPY at the last second of trading on each business day since 1993 and sold at the market open the next day  capturing all of the net after-hour gains  your cumulative price gain would be 571 percent.', 'On the other hand, if you had done the reverse, buying the E.T.F. at the first second of regular trading every morning at 9:30 a.m. and selling at the 4 p.m. close, you would be down 4.4 percent since 1993.', 'For 25 years, in other words, the daytime has been a net loss. To paraphrase Ray Charles, the nighttime has been the right time to be invested in the stock market.', 'One implication is immediate. Forget about the news and the market ups and downs during the day, said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. They are nowhere close to what they are cracked up to be. In fact, he said, most people are better off if they just sit tight.', 'Buying and holding the overall market  using an E.T.F. like the SPY, or a traditional index mutual fund, or a very diversified portfolio of stocks  has been an extremely profitable strategy if you stuck to it for the last 25 years. On the other hand, buying and selling during the day has generally been a money-losing strategy  one that would have been far more painful if you had traded frequently, incurring steep costs, which would have compounded your losses.', 'That said, there are plenty of exceptions to these general statements.', 'Many individuals and institutions have made tons of money through short-term trading during regular trading hours, even if investors over all have not. Furthermore, the steadily rising stock market in the 12 months through January has been better in the daytime than it has been historically  posting gains in the SPY during regular trading hours of 9.2 percent. Still, the overnight gains have been much better: 13.4 percent over the same period. The gap in returns has endured.', 'Why it has done so is the subject of speculation. Weve got hypotheses, said Michael Kelly, a finance professor at Lafayette College, who has studied the issue. But we dont really know why it happens.', 'One possibility, he said, is that frequent traders laboring under the illusion of control believe that they can respond easily to information and events during the day but cant do so as easily after hours, when there are far fewer market participants and less money, or liquidity, involved in trading. People may be inclined to sell at the market close so they can feel in control of their money overnight, he said.', 'There is some evidence that smaller traders are prey to this tendency and tend to sell late in the day  and that some big institutional traders, who are well aware of the day-night gap, tend instead to buy at the close and sell at the open.', 'Because relatively few people actually trade after the market closes, orders tend to build up overnight, and in a rising market, that will produce an upward price surge when the market opens. But during extended declines, overnight sell orders may cause prices to plummet when the market opens.', 'If there were no trading costs  possible in a thought experiment but not in the real world  an excellent strategy over the last few decades would have been buying shares at the last possible moment during regular trading hours and selling them methodically at the opening bell every day, Professor Gulen of Purdue said.', 'While transaction costs make that strategy uneconomical, he said, the concept may still have a certain value. If you do know that you are going to make a trade on a given day, and you have the ability to choose when you do it, you might be able to take advantage of this pattern  buying late in the day and selling early. Of course, the pattern doesnt hold every single day, and you could easily be disappointed.', 'Part of the gap in returns can probably be explained by the human tendency to panic at bad news, Professor Kelly said. That panic seems to happen during the day, he said. One advantage of not trading during the day is that you arent as likely to participate in panicky selling.', 'His data shows that during the bear market year of 2008, the overall market, as represented by the SPY E.T.F., declined 36.8 percent. But most of the damage occurred during the day, with losses of 26.7 percent, compared with only 13.8 percent overnight.', 'But further study needs to be done before the mystery of the day-night gap is unraveled, he said.', 'In the meantime, Mr. Hickey said, If you are tempted to day trade, this is another argument for not doing it, he said. And trading after hours is in some ways, even riskier, because with fewer people in the market, prices can be erratic.', 'Slow and steady investing generally avoids these problems. And over long periods, it has paid off. Frequent trading generally has not, either night or day.']
