Kyle Glanville should have been thrilled. All 70 of the outdoor seats at Go Get Em Tiger were taken, only three days after he and his partner opened the cafe in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles.

He was not. “Everybody was at a laptop wearing headphones,” Mr. Glanville said. He strode inside, unplugged the device that provided free Wi-Fi and tossed it into a bin in his office.

He wanted a courtyard where people talked to one another, not a silent office for remote workers. And while anyone with a cellphone hot spot could connect without his help, he had made himself clear. On a recent weekday morning, almost a year and a half later, the courtyard was still full of people, but this time they were talking to one another. Only one was at his laptop.

Remote workers have staked out coffee shops for years, but small-business owners say their ranks are rising. In 2016, 43 percent of American employees spent some time working remotely, according to a Gallup survey; the number who telecommute at least half the time has grown by 115 percent since 2005, said a report last year from FlexJobs and Global Workplace Analytics. Add in the self-employed, and the crowd gets even bigger. And while some still embrace the home-and-pajama model, a large contingent hits the corner cafe.

Starbucks may not feel the pinch, with its multibillion-dollar revenues and legions of grab-and-go customers, but for owners of smaller businesses, the math is grim.

“Three hours for five dollars’ worth of coffee is not a model that works,” said David Wynn, co-owner of Triniti, a tiny cafe that opened two months ago east of Mr. Glanville’s place, on Sunset Boulevard.

Owners face a choice: Get tough and encourage workers to relocate, or embrace them and hope that a combination of guilt and loyalty will inspire them to spend more or leave sooner.

It’s hard to know which is the right answer. “There’s no social order here to tell us how to behave,” said Mr. Glanville, as though he were contemplating a newly formed nation, which in a way he is. He took a no-tolerance stance on Wi-Fi because a single ground rule seemed more hospitable than a litany of restrictions.

Rich Nieto thought he was being tough enough when he limited workers to a dedicated laptop room at his 25-seat Sweetleaf cafe in Long Island City, Queens. But when all eight laptop seats were taken one afternoon, a customer simply retired to another room, tore away the wallpaper to expose a purposely covered electrical outlet, and plugged in.

“You can’t win that battle,” said Mr. Nieto, who had already learned his lesson the hard way. “The first time I saw someone with a laptop I said, ‘Sorry, no laptops,’ ” he said. “Right after that, I got a one-star review on Yelp.”

Jody Williams, who with Rita Sodi owns the West Village restaurant Via Carota and has her own smaller place, Buvette, dislikes talking about policy and prefers to say that “laptops are frowned on.” A staff member will approach the uninitiated customer whose laptop is open for more than a couple of minutes with a gentle but firm request “to finish up what you’re doing and close the laptop, please,” she said.

When she and Ms. Sodi open Pisellino, a new cafe, in April, the no-work attitude will be embedded in the design: a standing bar only 12 inches deep, no Wi-Fi, no outlets, five small cafe tables inside and 20 outside when the weather allows. Little opportunity to set up shop.

Even companies committed to accommodating remote workers look for ways to improve the relationship. At Triniti, Mr. Wynn offers free Wi-Fi, but after two hours a customer must have “a face-to-face interaction” with an employee, he says, to get a new password. He relies on that interaction and the aromas from the kitchen to transform coffee drinkers into lunch customers, and has been gratified as the first wave of workers have started to order midday meals.

Bailey Arnold, director of education for Gregorys Coffee, says that many of the Manhattan-based company’s 25 outlets are in business districts to tap into a reliable stream of customers. But recently the company installed a brew bar at three branches, to emphasize coffee and conversation — and to speed turnover, and get away from what she calls “the old oblivious row of laptop, laptop, laptop.”

If someone stakes out too much turf — if their belongings sprawl into nearby seating — it’s time for a polite intervention. “We won’t move anybody’s stuff,” Ms. Arnold said, “but an employee might start to clean the adjacent table and hope they get the hint.”

And if that doesn’t work, eventually the furniture will send a message. “The seating isn’t all that comfortable” for long sessions, she said.

Jason Neroni, the chef and a partner in the Rose Cafe, in the Venice, Calif., neighborhood known as Silicon Beach, said he was happy to run what he called “a commissary” for the nearby offices of Google, BuzzFeed and Snapchat, and for self-employed people.

He sees them as the nascent regulars of tomorrow — and with 300 seats, he can afford to invest 85 to 90 cafe and patio seats in the future, and still maintain a no-laptop policy in the main dining room.

He employs subtle means to influence the behavior of working customers. Logging in for two hours of free Wi-Fi requires the user’s email address, which goes onto the Rose’s mailing list — and while people can log right back in, the expiration reminds them that it might be time to order another round. Servers circulate to ask if they can get something else for a customer tied to his electronic devices. And Wi-Fi service ends at 5:30 p.m., to signal that the workday has ended and dinner service is about to begin.

Mr. Neroni tried extending the Wi-Fi until 7 one night, “as an experiment,” he said. “People looked up and figured we forgot to turn it off. And it was ‘Oh, boy,’ and a line of people carrying their open laptops into the dining room so they could keep working.” He reminded the disappointed throng of the dining-room no-laptop policy and resumed the 5:30 cutoff.

Like most cafes, the Rose doesn’t provide electrical outlets; a dwindling battery should be a sign that it’s time to go.

Some remote workers have gotten the message, and try to do their part. Jocelyn Johnson, who founded VideoInk, a digital trade publication about online video, relies on remote work sites including the Rose. She has defined a code of conduct to prove herself a good citizen.

Her self-imposed rules include working in one cafe or restaurant no more than three mornings a week, for no more than three hours at a stretch. She always orders a coffee and pastry, and frequently a lunch to go. Then she packs up and heads to another spot on her preferred list.

The only casualty of the plan is her social life, which she had hoped might include the Rose as well: She tried a weekend brunch there, only to realize that it felt too much like the office.

“I couldn’t enjoy myself,” she said. “I kept feeling that I ought to be working.”

Brian Swichkow, her frequent tablemate, has no such problem. Known to friends and colleagues as “the Rose Cafe guy” because he frequently shows up in the restaurant’s Instagram photos, Mr. Swichkow, the founder of ghostinfluence.com, takes his regular seat six or seven mornings a week, from which he advises clients on how to develop “digital empathy” in their online marketing.

He budgets $350 a month to cover coffee, frequent breakfasts and lunch to go if he’s headed straight to a meeting. Business lunches or drinks are always at the Rose — and yet he figures his home away from home still costs about $100 less than a shared work space.

But there’s a big gap between a customer who invests in his remote work space and one who rips the wallpaper to get at an outlet. Cafe owners find it difficult to define a consistent strategy without a proven, profitable relationship model.

Mr. Glanville yanked the Wi-Fi at Go Get Em Tiger, but he provides it at two other locations that are not as much of a hub for remote workers. He’ll do so again at a smaller fourth cafe opening this spring in Highland Park, in northeastern Los Angeles.

He can’t imagine that remote workers will find the new place a comfortable home, so he has decided to take a chance and accommodate people who want recreational access.

Still, there’s no way to know for sure if the working masses will turn up. “If they can figure out how to work squished into 15 seats with Prince blaring on the sound system,” he said, with a shrug, “more power to them.”

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• While the Republican tax overhaul would add up to an overall cut for individual taxpayers, at least through 2025, millions could face immediate tax increases. (Check the numbers for each income group here.)

For those in high-tax (and Democratic-leaning) states, the increase would come from the repeal of the state and local tax deduction.

New York City and its neighbors would be particularly hard hit, according to our overview of the bill’s regional impact. “Who’s going to want to buy our house here in New York?” a resident of an affluent commuter town said. “The whole game has shifted.”

• We also explain the push by Republican lawmakers to discredit a nonpartisan agency they had long praised, after it threatened to derail their $1.5 trillion tax rewrite.

• The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the third version of the measure to go into effect while legal challenges continue.

Most citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen will be barred from entering the U.S., as will some Venezuelans.

• The move  suggests that the administration’s chances of prevailing when the justices consider the ban have markedly increased.

• Republican leaders are again coalescing around the Senate candidate in Alabama, with President Trump endorsing him on Monday and the party’s national committee restoring its support.

Mr. Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct against teenage girls.

• Republicans appear increasingly confident that Mr. Moore will win the special election next week. Here’s what has happened since the allegations against him emerged.

• Representative John Conyers Jr., the Michigan Democrat who has been accused of sexual harassment, said today that he was leaving Congress immediately, and endorsed his son, John Conyers III, to replace him.

Separately, a woman who reached a settlement with Bill O’Reilly over harassment allegations sued him and Fox News for defamation and breach of contract.

• The Times has started a newsletter, The #MeToo Moment, in which our gender editor, Jessica Bennett, offers updates and analysis. Sign up here.

• That’s one analyst’s assessment of what lies ahead after the killing of Ali Abdullah Saleh, the former president of one of the Arab world’s poorest countries. His death on Monday shattered the alliance between his loyalists and Houthi rebels.

“His being killed like this is going to deepen the conflict,” April Longley Alley of the International Crisis Group added. “This just adds more layers of revenge.”

• Renewed fighting in the capital, Sana, could worsen the humanitarian crisis, which the U.N. has called the world’s worst.

• The International Olympic Committee is to decide today how to punish Russia for its elaborate doping scheme in the 2014 Winter Olympics.

Possible sanctions include a ban from the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in February. But that could hurt the Winter Olympics more than it hurts Russia.

• The Olympic committee has a history of being timid and slow in addressing delicate subjects. “Spoiler alert: Some insiders say this thing is going to fizzle,” our sports columnist  writes.

Listen on a computer, an iOS device or an Android device.

• CVS and Aetna promise better care and lower costs if they merge, but skeptics question whether the companies can deliver.

• Facebook introduced an app for children ages 13 and younger, reigniting a debate over how young is too young for social media.

• Google, which missed out on the rise of the internet in China, is determined not to make that mistake in India.

And Amazon began operations in Australia today.

• Partisan writing you shouldn’t miss.

Writers from across the political spectrum discuss the Republican tax plan.

• In memoriam.

John Anderson, a former Republican congressman, left his party to run as a plain-spoken independent candidate for president in 1980, drawing an enthusiastic if transient following among liberals and college students. He was 95.

• “SpongeBob SquarePants,” the musical.

“You are never going to see as convincing an impersonation of a two-dimensional cartoon by a three-dimensional human as that provided by Ethan Slater at the Palace Theater.”

Our theater critic  reviewed Monday night’s opening of the TV series-turned-Broadway show.

• Best of late-night TV.

On “The Late Show,” Billy Bush gave his first televised interview since the presidential election.

• Quotation of the day.

“Right now, it’s ‘those nutty entomologists.’ But I think this is going to get more and more attention, not just from crazy people with long hair.”

— Josef Tumbrinck, a member of the Entomological Society Krefeld in Germany, which recently reported that insect populations there had dropped more than 75 percent in three decades.

The Times headline was unassuming in its brevity: “Claude Monet dies; famous painter.”

A week after the French artist died on this day in 1926, we were more effusive, praising Monet as “one of the names in the history of art to which will be attached a single idea, the idea of light.”

Born in 1840, he was famous for outdoor scenes and for reproducing the effects of light, whether on water lilies, haystacks or the cities of Europe.

Impressionism, the name of the movement he helped found in the 1870s, was derived from “Impression, Sunrise,” the title of his painting of the harbor of Le Havre in France. Coined derisively by a critic, the name was adopted by Monet and his fellow Impressionists, including Pierre Auguste Renoir and Camille Pissarro.

Almost a century after his death, Monet still captures the public’s imagination. Last year, his painting “Meule” fetched $81.4 million with fees, a new auction high for his work. The painting of a grainstack at sunset reflected the artist’s long fascination with light.

“These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me,” Monet wrote in 1909. “It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel.”

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• The U.S. accused Syria’s government of another chlorine gas attack on civilians and rebuked Russia for failing to stop such a war crime.

Separately, a strategic city, Manbij, is emerging as the ultimate target of the Turkish offensive into Kurdish-controlled territory in Syria.

An assault there could bring Turkish forces into direct conflict with American troops stationed there, with unpredictable results.

Here’s a tale of innovation and why it’s hard to stand in the way of progress.

Eighty-three years ago, the first-known canned beer was sold in the U.S., in Richmond, Va. The innovation soon spread to a brewer in Wales.

The cans were lighter and cheaper than bottles, and immediately proved a huge success.

“Sales resistance to beer in cans has been overcome in every section of the country,” The Times reported a few months later in 1935. “The product is selling more rapidly than it can be supplied.”

Within two months, the American Can Co. was producing 25,000 to 30,000 beer cans every day.

By September, U.S. winemakers sought to package their product in cans, too, to “induce the American consumer to ‘become wine-minded,’ ” The Times reported.

Bottle makers pushed back against the new competition.

At a conference in Atlantic City, they spoke of plans for lighter bottles, as well as ones that wouldn’t require a deposit.

Regardless of what it was packaged in, beer was popular in post-Prohibition America. Sales of bottled and canned beer grew more than 50 percent in the first half of 1936 over the previous year, The Times reported.

By 1970, beer cans had overtaken bottles.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• It’s over, three days after it began.

The federal government reopened Monday night after Senate Democrats agreed to a short-term spending bill without addressing the fate of young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.

The vote exposed a rift between moderate Democrats who are up for re-election this year in states President Trump won and their more liberal counterparts. Here’s how every senator voted.

Tucked into the measure that will fund the government through Feb. 8: $31 billion more in tax cuts.

• Immigration activists were furious, but our chief Washington correspondent notes the quandary that Democrats faced: “While the Dreamers may be a highly sympathetic group, using them as a rationale for shuttering the federal government was not playing well.”

• Talks to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement, which President Trump has called a “disaster,” resume this week.

With the future of the 24-year-old pact uncertain, we looked at three products that Nafta has shaped.

• Separately on Monday, the U.S. slapped steep tariffs on washing machines and solar energy cells and panels, the first major step to erect the kind of trade barriers that Mr. Trump has said are necessary to protect American manufacturers.

• Turkey is waging an all-out assault against Syrian Kurds, American allies against the Islamic State. Turkey considers them terrorists and a threat to its territorial sovereignty.

The offensive, carried out over the protests of the U.S. but apparently with the assent of Russia, demonstrates how much leverage Washington has lost in Syria, where the American focus has been on vanquishing Islamist militants.

• Now that ISIS is in retreat, the White House is trying to maintain relations with the Kurdish fighters without further alienating the Turks. Here’s background information on the conflict.

• Attorney General Jeff Sessions was questioned for several hours last week by the special counsel’s office as part of the investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election, according to a Justice Department spokeswoman.

•  It is  the first time that investigators for the special counsel, Robert Mueller III, are known to have interviewed a member of President Trump’s cabinet.

• An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.9 struck 170 miles off the southern coast early today, prompting a tsunami warning.

There were no immediate reports of damage.

• A strong quake also struck off the southern coast of the Indonesian island of Java, rocking buildings in the capital, Jakarta.

• In the latest decision striking down political maps that unduly favor one party, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania said on Monday that Republican-nominated districts “clearly, plainly and palpably” violated the state’s Constitution.

A new map must be submitted by next month, the court said.

• We looked at  the ruling’s implications for Pennsylvania’s electoral future.

• The World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, begins today. There’s a sense of optimism as populist movements wane. (There’s also plenty of snow.)

The conversation is already dominated by one topic: What will President Trump say? You can find all of our Davos coverage here.

• Elon Musk has agreed to stay on as Tesla’s chief executive for the next decade, with his pay tied to $50 billion increases in the company’s valuation. Otherwise, he makes zero.

• Six weeks after firing the former congressman Harold Ford Jr. for unspecified misconduct, Morgan Stanley clarified that the misconduct was not sexual in nature.

• In memoriam

Naomi Parker Fraley was the long-unrecognized inspiration for Rosie the Riveter, a bit of 1940s popular culture who became a feminist touchstone in the late 20th century. She was 96.

• And the nominees are …

“The Shape of Water,” directed by Guillermo del Toro, led today’s nominations for the 90th Academy Awards, with 13.

“Dunkirk” and “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” were close behind. Here’s the full list of nominees.

The Oscars ceremony is March 4.

• A new coach in New York

The Giants, who lost 13 games this season for the first time in the team’s 92-year history, named Pat Shurmur as head coach.

He was formerly the offensive coordinator with the Minnesota Vikings.

• You asked. Our new publisher answered.

A. G. Sulzberger responded to questions from readers about his role and the future of The Times.

• Best of late-night TV

The shutdown ended, but Seth Meyers wasn’t exactly rejoicing.

• Quotation of the day

“People normally do not throw a bachelor party without a bachelor.”

— Justice Clarence Thomas, writing the majority opinion in a Supreme Court ruling that the police were entitled to arrest late-night partygoers at what some had claimed was a bachelor party.

• The Times, in other words

Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles.

“Remember the Maine!” was a rallying cry of the Spanish-American War. Many North Americans surely remember the Alamo. But has the U.S.S. Pueblo been forgotten?

On this day in 1968, the Pueblo, a Navy intelligence ship, was attacked and seized by North Korean patrol boats. Its 83 crew members were taken to Pyongyang and charged as spies, drawing a tense Cold War standoff.

A Times editorial called the attack “humiliating,” and a prisoner drama — marked by fraught negotiations, forced confessions and propaganda ploys — dragged on for 11 months. Here’s more about the Pueblo incident.

The Americans told of beatings, torture and deprivation, but they still found ways to get back at their captors. They slipped outrageous puns into self-written confessions, such as this one by the ship’s commander, and surreptitiously raised their middle fingers in films and photographs. (The sailors said it was the Hawaiian good luck salute.)

In the end, Washington reluctantly apologized, and the Pueblo crew was home in time for Christmas. The Pueblo itself is still in Pyongyang, where it’s a tourist attraction at the Victorious War Museum.

Charles McDermid contributed reporting.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• The U.S. government remains shut down. Senators inched toward a compromise on Sunday but failed to reach a deal.

President Trump’s unwillingness or inability to articulate his preferred immigration policy has complicated the impasse, our White House correspondents report.

Here’s what the shutdown looks like, and how it could hurt the U.S. economy.

_____

• In a reprise of last year’s Women’s March, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators marched across the U.S. and beyond to show their support for women’s rights and opposition to President Trump’s policies.

Our photographers asked marchers across the U.S. what their hopes were for 2018. And our senior correspondent for gender looks at how the marches evolved from a moment to a movement.

_____

• Turkish troops crossed the Syria border into the Kurdish enclave Afrin, beginning a ground assault against American-allied militias there.

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the forces intended to create a security zone some 30 kilometers deep inside Syria. By nightfall troops appeared to have advanced only a few kilometers.

There are reports of Syrian fighters massing to join the fight on both sides.

_____

• “We agreed to disagree.”

That was Vice President Mike Pence speaking to reporters after a “very frank discussion” with King Abdullah II of Jordan in Amman about U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.

The Trump administration’s hard-line position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, our foreign policy columnist writes, has shifted America’s culture war to the global stage.

Mr. Pence continues his Middle East trip in Israel today. Meanwhile, E.U. foreign ministers are to meet Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president.

_____

• In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel inched a step closer to forming a new government after the Social Democrats narrowly voted in favor of entering coalition talks with her conservative camp.

Social Democrats opposed to another grand coalition warn that it would make the far-right Alternative for Germany the biggest opposition party in Parliament.

The final coalition agreement will also need the approval of a majority of party members.

Today marks a big step for equality in the entertainment industry.

Minnie Mouse is set to finally receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, 90 years after she was introduced and nearly 40 years after her longtime love interest, Mickey, received one in 1978, above.

First voiced by Walt Disney himself, the characters made their debut in the 1928 animated short “Steamboat Willie.”

Minnie went on to appear in more than 60 cartoon shorts, primarily in the 1930s, before becoming a perennial presence on television and at Disney’s theme parks around the world.

Originally drawn wearing a pillbox hat, Minnie later sported a polka-dot bow on her head that matched her dress. “Minnie: Style Icon,” an exhibition at London Fashion Week in 2015, traced her influence over the decades.

But she has always dwelt in Mickey’s shadow, the damsel to his leading man. In a 1934 essay titled “Mickey and Minnie,” the British novelist E. M. Forster lamented: “About Minnie too little has been said, and her name at the top of this article is an act of homage which ought to have been paid long ago.”

Another act of homage will come today in Hollywood, when she is honored with the 2,627th star on the Walk of Fame.
