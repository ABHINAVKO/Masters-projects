WASHINGTON Â Justice Anthony M. Kennedy has long been troubled by extreme partisan gerrymandering, where the party in power draws voting districts to give itself a lopsided advantage in elections. But he has never found a satisfactory way to determine when voting maps are so warped by politics that they cross a constitutional line.

After spirited Supreme Court arguments on Tuesday, there was reason to think Justice Kennedy may be ready to join the courtÂs more liberal members in a groundbreaking decision that could reshape American democracy by letting courts determine when lawmakers have gone too far.

Justice Kennedy asked skeptical questions of lawyers defending a Wisconsin legislative map that gave Republicans many more seats in the State Assembly than their statewide vote tallies would have predicted. He asked no questions of the lawyer representing the Democratic voters challenging the map.

There was something like consensus among the justices that voting maps drawn by politicians to give advantage to their parties are an unattractive feature of American democracy. But the justices appeared split about whether the court could find a standard for determining when the practice was unconstitutional.

ÂGerrymandering is distasteful,Â said Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., Âbut if we are going to impose a standard on the courts, it has to be something thatÂs manageable.Â

Some of the courtÂs more liberal members said the problem represented a crisis for democracy and that the Supreme Court should step in.

ÂWhatÂs really behind all of this?Â Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked. She answered her own question: ÂThe precious right to vote.Â

In extended remarks, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. expressed worry that the courtÂs authority and legitimacy would be hurt were it to start striking down voting districts in favor of one political party or another.

ÂThat is going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this court in the eyes of the country,Â he said.

Paul M. Smith, a lawyer for the Democratic voters, urged the court to act. ÂYou are the only institution in the United States that can solve this problem just as democracy is about to get worse because of the way gerrymandering is getting so much worse,Â he told the justices.

Without the Supreme CourtÂs intervention, Mr. Smith said, other states will follow WisconsinÂs lead. The round of redistricting that will follow the 2020 census, he said, Âwill produce a festival of copycat gerrymandering the likes of which this country has never seen.Â

The Supreme Court has never struck down an election map on the ground that it was drawn to make sure one political party wins an outsize number of seats. The court has, however, left open the possibility that some kinds of political gamesmanship in redistricting may be too extreme.

The problem, Justice Kennedy wrote in a 2004 concurrence, is that no one has devised Âa workable standardÂ to decide when the political gerrymandering has crossed a constitutional line.

On Tuesday, he pressed Erin E. Murphy, a lawyer for Wisconsin lawmakers, about whether a state law could require drawing districts to have the maximum number of votes for a given political party. Other justices followed up on the point, and Ms. Murphy gave equivocal answers.

Justice Kennedy grew frustrated. ÂI have to say that I donÂt think you ever answered the question,Â he said.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Ms. Murphy more fundamental questions.

ÂCould you tell me what the value is to democracy from political gerrymandering?Â Justice Sotomayor asked. ÂHow does that help our system of government?Â

Ms. Murphy said that gerrymandering Âproduces values in terms of accountability that are valuable so that the people understand who isnÂt and who is in power.Â

That did not seem a sufficient reason, Justice Sotomayor said, Âto stack the decks.Â

Much of the argument concerned various statistical tests for identifying extreme gerrymandering. Misha Tseytlin, WisconsinÂs solicitor general, said the challengers were relying on flimsy and hypothetical social science evidence.

ÂPlaintiffs are asking this court to launch a redistricting revolution based upon their social science metrics,Â he said.

Chief Justice Roberts told Mr. Smith that courts are poorly equipped to evaluate social science data. ÂIt may be simply my educational background,Â the chief justice said of the studies before the court, Âbut I can only describe it as sociological gobbledygook.Â

Other justices seemed more comfortable with the studies.

ÂThis is not kind of hypothetical, airy-fairy, we guess, and then we guess again,Â Justice Elena Kagan said. ÂI mean, this is pretty scientific by this point.Â

Justice Sotomayor said that Âevery single social science metric points in the same direction.Â

There may be close cases, Justice Kagan said, but this was not one of them. ÂThis map goes pretty much over every line,Â she said.

Justice Stephen G. Breyer, in remarks that may have been aimed at Justice Kennedy, sketched out a series of criteria that he said amounted to a workable standard. He said courts should act only when there is one-party control of the state government and a map that creates a persistent and unjustified partisan advantage that is Âan extreme outlierÂ when compared to other maps.

ÂI suspect that thatÂs manageable,Â Justice Breyer said.

The case, Gill v. Whitford, No. 16-1161, started when Republicans gained complete control of WisconsinÂs government in 2010 for the first time at the beginning of a redistricting cycle in more than 40 years. Lawmakers promptly drew a map for the State Assembly that helped Republicans convert very close statewide vote totals into lopsided legislative majorities.

In 2012, after the redistricting, Republicans won 48.6 percent of the statewide vote for Assembly candidates but captured 60 of the AssemblyÂs 99 seats.

Democratic voters sued, saying the maps violated the Constitution. ÂThis is one of the most extreme gerrymanders ever drawn in living memory of the United States,Â Mr. Smith said on Tuesday.

The case is part of a larger debate over politics in redistricting, one that has taken on new urgency with the advent of sophisticated software. Both parties have engaged in partisan gerrymandering, but these days, Republicans have an advantage following a wave of victories in state legislatures that allowed lawmakers to draw election maps favoring their party.

Some critics, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican and the former governor of California, say districts should be drawn by independent commissions rather than politicians. Prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and his first attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., are pushing to undo the redistricting gains Republicans made after the 2010 census when the next census is taken three years from now.

Outside the court during the arguments, several dozen activists rallied with signs that read ÂEqual Districts Under LawÂ and ÂHands off our Districts!Â

Mr. Schwarzenegger, who attended the argument, said afterward that he is hopeful that the justices will put a stop to partisan gerrymandering.

ÂWe are here today to ask the Supreme Court to fix something that the politicians will never do,Â he said. ÂAs Einstein said, those who created the problem will not be able to solve it.Â

Last year, a divided three-judge Federal District Court panel ruled that Republicans in Wisconsin had gone too far. The map, Judge Kenneth F. Ripple wrote for the majority, Âwas designed to make it more difficult for Democrats, compared to Republicans, to translate their votes into seats.Â

The decision was the first from a federal court in more than 30 years to reject a voting map as partisan gerrymandering.

Wisconsin officials say that the lopsided representation of Republicans in the State Legislature is a product of geography rather than gerrymandering. Democrats have packed themselves into cities, effectively diluting their voting power, while Republicans are more evenly distributed across most states, the brief said.

Judge Ripple acknowledged that the distribution of the population explains at least some part of the gap.

ÂWisconsinÂs political geography, particularly the high concentration of Democratic voters in urban centers like Milwaukee and Madison, affords the Republican Party a natural, but modest, advantage in the districting process,Â he wrote.

But he added that partisan gerrymandering amplified that advantage.

LOS ANGELES Â In any other year, big-hearted dramas like ÂStranger ThingsÂ or ÂThis Is UsÂ or a period drama like ÂThe CrownÂ would dominate the Emmys.

But this was no normal year.

This is a moment in which the partisan chasm has widened and political discourse has taken on a greater sense of urgency. Bright lines are dividing those supporting President Trump and those vilifying him, and Hollywood has never been shy about signaling where it stands.

And so Sunday nightÂs Emmy Awards, as much as they were a celebration of artistic accomplishment, were also a statement that, eight months into a Trump presidency, topical and decidedly progressive shows rule the day in television Â at least among the industry insiders who dole out the accolades.

ÂSaturday Night Live,Â which revived its fortunes last season with a weekly skewering of Mr. Trump, claimed the most awards of any show Sunday. ÂThe HandmaidÂs Tale,Â a dystopian drama that tapped into fears about authoritarianism in America, nabbed best drama and several other awards. And individual winners like Alec Baldwin, Donald Glover and John Oliver took the stage to spoof Mr. Trump and give voice to the liberal worldview that prevails in much of the entertainment industry.

A few hours after the ceremony, the former Emmy winner Jon Hamm described it as Âthe most diverse, most different, most interesting Emmy show IÂve ever seen.Â

When his former co-star on ÂMad Men,Â Elisabeth Moss, was asked if she had seen an Emmys quite this political, she was emphatic.

ÂAbsolutely not,Â she said, holding an Emmy in each hand, including the one she won for best actress for ÂHandmaidÂs.Â ÂBut IÂve also never seen anything like where our country is right now.Â

All year, late night shows with an anti-Trump bent and left-leaning cable news shows like Rachel MaddowÂs on MSNBC have seen their ratings soar, and now that political posture has received the seal of approval from Emmys voters.

But it also means that the Emmys, and all awards shows, for that matter, are part of a broader cultural divide. And to its critics, Hollywood may be proving yet again that it lives in an elite, self-congratulatory bubble, showering awards on shows that reflect its worldview while ignoring the millions of people who prefer ÂNCISÂ and ÂThe Walking Dead.Â

ÂRemember, itÂs California,Â said Margaret Atwood, the author of the novel ÂThe HandmaidÂs TaleÂ on which the Hulu show was based, as she glided into her first Emmys party at age 77. ÂThis would not happen in a lot of other states. This would, in fact, be a lot different. This is its own world here.Â

The show did not draw a big audience. The ceremony, hosted by Stephen Colbert, attracted just 11.38 million viewers, Nielsen said, in line with last yearÂs total, which was a record low.

On Fox News on Monday morning, the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said viewers were Âtuning outÂ because of how politicized the Emmys have become, and suggested that HollywoodÂs anti-Trump posturing had become tiresome.

ÂThey got plucked and polished and waxed, and some of them didnÂt eat for two months, and all for what?Â she said. ÂTo sound the same?Â

Still, the heated political climate produced some startling changes for the Emmys.

ÂSaturday Night LiveÂ has never appealed much to Emmy voters, and they had not given it a top show award in more than two decades. But just two years removed from inviting Mr. Trump to host ÂS.N.L.,Â the NBC late night show excoriated him this past season, and reaped the rewards: Mr. Baldwin won an Emmy for his portrayal of Mr. Trump, and Kate McKinnon, who portrayed both Ms. Conway and Hillary Clinton, won an Emmy as well.

ÂÂS.N.L.Â had a career year,Â said Warren Littlefield, a longtime Emmy voter who is a former NBC executive and a producer of ÂHandmaidÂs.Â ÂYou had to watch ÂS.N.L.Â to get an appreciation of the world weÂre living in, and it helped us endure what weÂre all living with.Â

Other shows benefited as well, including Mr. OliverÂs ÂLast Week Tonight,Â which won the prize for best variety talk show for the second consecutive year. Mr. Oliver delights in using Mr. Trump as a punching bag on his show.

Mr. Glover of ÂAtlantaÂ and Julia Louis-Dreyfus of ÂVeepÂ were among the many winners who mocked President Trump on stage. And after Mr. Baldwin won, he alluded to the fact that Mr. Trump had long coveted an Emmy but never won one. ÂI suppose I should say, at long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy,Â Mr. Baldwin quipped.

What benefited those shows, however, appeared to have hurt dramas like ÂStranger ThingsÂ and ÂThis Is Us,Â both of which were decidedly retro and unpolitical.

ÂStranger ThingsÂ was a sci-fi homage to movies like ÂStand by MeÂ and ÂE.T.Â NBCÂs ÂThis Is UsÂ was a heart-on-your-sleeve family drama that took inspiration from the 1983 tear-jerker ÂTerms of Endearment.Â

Still, HuluÂs success was a shock in its own right. Hulu, which is co-owned by Disney, Comcast, Time Warner and 21st Century Fox, has a smaller programming budget compared with those of streaming rivals like Netflix and Amazon.

But ÂHandmaidÂs,Â which was in development long before the Trump administration, struck a chord with viewers concerned about womenÂs rights, and its creators proudly embraced the fact that some regarded their show as eerily timely.

ÂPolitics is at the front of everybodyÂs head, not in the back of everybodyÂs mind,Â said Bruce Miller, an executive producer for ÂHandmaidÂs.Â ÂI think all of the media, including the fictional and nonfictional media, are benefiting from taking that head-on. I have been told that you donÂt talk about religion and politics in kind company. Well, thereÂs no company now where you donÂt talk about politics these days.Â

ÂPeople are talking about and thinking about some serious things and things that are uncomfortable,Â he added. ÂShows that directly address difficult topics are having their day in the sun.Â

Early reviews for the series, which had its premiere three months after the inauguration, were positive, and it has been the show of the year for many TV critics.

HuluÂs marketing department took no chances. The streaming service bought its first-ever Super Bowl ad for an original series, even though the event was months before the premiere. And throughout the year, Hulu hired actresses to don red capes like characters in the show, and circulate in cities like Austin (during the South by Southwest Festival), New York, Los Angeles and Washington to create word-of-mouth buzz.

And as Hulu increases the size of its budget Â it will be about $2.5 billion for content this year Â a basketful of Emmys is the kind of payoff that may generate even more spending, especially as digital titans like Facebook, Google and Apple enter the scripted television market.

Because Hulu does not release viewership data, it is impossible to know how popular ÂHandmaidÂsÂ was, but it was far more successful than its previous iteration. In 1990, the novel was adapted into a feature film that was a flop at the box office and did not receive warm reviews.

ÂWe got a Trump bump!Â said Daniel Wilson, a producer behind both the movie and the TV show. ÂTiming is everything. If we didnÂt have the president we have now, I donÂt know if it would have been this successful.Â

Ms. Atwood underscored that point as well.

ÂI wrote it in 1985,Â she said. ÂThere was some incredulity then: ÂMargaret, youÂre way over the top! it could never happen here.ÂÂ

ÂAnd now?Â she continued. ÂI donÂt hear any of that.Â

ORLANDO, Fla. Â Every day dozens of Puerto Ricans straggle into the Orlando area, fleeing their homes and lives ravaged by Hurricane Maria. In the months to come, officials here said, that number could surge to more than 100,000.

And those numbers could remake politics in Florida, a state where the last two presidential and governorÂs races were decided by roughly one percentage point or less.

There are more than a million Puerto Ricans in Florida, a number that has doubled since 2001, driven largely until now by a faltering economy. But their political powers have evolved slowly in this state, and the wave of potential voters from the island could quickly change that calculus.

If the estimates hold, and several officials said they might be low, the Puerto Rican vote, which has been strongly Democratic, could have rough parity with the Cuban vote in the state, for years a bulwark for Republicans in both state and national races.

ÂWhatÂs clear is that this is going to be a more powerful swing group,Â said Anthony Suarez, a lawyer here, who has run for office as both a Republican and a Democrat. ÂJust like everybody has to go to Miami and stop in Versailles to have coffee to court the Cuban community, that is going to start happening here.Â

In Central Florida, home to more than 350,000 Puerto Ricans, their political impact has already been felt. Last year, Representative Darren Soto, a Democrat, became the first member of Congress of Puerto Rican descent elected from Florida when he won a Central Florida district with a large Puerto Rican population.

Mr. Soto said any significant shift in population in such a highly competitive state could have an enormous impact.

ÂMy district has the most island-born Puerto Ricans of any congressional district, and that is already changing Florida politics,Â he said. And that change could be even more significant because of the widespread anger over President TrumpÂs response to the devastation caused by Maria Â the president, accused of reacting slowly to the crisis, said islanders were not doing enough to help themselves.

The anger, Mr. Soto said, Âcould have huge repercussions.Â ÂYou just donÂt attack people when they are down,Â he added. ÂThese are things people will remember.Â

While Democrats see enormous potential for registering new voters, they know their efforts must wait until the newcomersÂ urgent need for housing, jobs, schools and medical care is met. Central Florida will be a magnet for many of the migrants who will join families here in Orlando and in neighboring communities like Kissimmee. They will see signs of home in the grocery stores, shops and churches in an area where the Latino influence is abundantly evident.

In a ballroom of a Puerto Rican service organization here this week, a dozen men and women, including activists, a lawyer, an Orange County commissioner, a police officer and a psychotherapist, said the storm had brought the community together like never before.

ÂNow we see the necessity to come out and organize,Â said Trini Quiroz, one of the activists. ÂSo this tragedy brought us all together.Â

Under the umbrella of an organization called CASA, 14 different groups have banded together to help provide relief for hurricane victims, from collecting and delivering supplies to Puerto Rico to helping build a resettlement effort in Central Florida.

Emily Bonilla, a Democratic county commissioner who was elected from a district that is 80 percent white, is working to provide services for the new arrivals, mindful that they may soon be her constituents. ÂPuerto Ricans are unique,Â she said. ÂWe support each other regardless of party, but no surprise, the majority become Democrats.Â

Mr. Trump won about 35 percent of the Latino vote in the state in 2016, exit polls showed, with 54 percent of that share coming from Cuban-Americans. Hillary Clinton won about 70 percent of the non-Cuban Latino vote and had an almost three-to-one edge among Puerto Ricans.

Still, Republicans say that Puerto Ricans in Florida, unlike those in New York who overwhelmingly vote Democratic, can be a swing vote on many issues.

ÂWe are not a monolith,Â said Mr. Suarez, the lawyer here, who is now also helping place law students from the island in schools in Florida.

While Puerto Ricans are swing voters on a number of issues like taxes and abortion, Âwhen it comes to issues that affect the Puerto Rican community, they behave more like a voting bloc,Â said Edwin MelÃ©ndez, director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York.

Maribel Cordero, a psychotherapist who is running for a seat on the county commission in Orange County, said that there were signs of a political awakening. ÂA lot of things are going to change,Â she said. ÂThey will have to win our trust,Â she said of elected officials, adding, Âwe are all united, and we want a place at the table.Â

That puts additional pressure on Mr. Trump to reverse the perception that he was indifferent to Puerto Rico, at least initially.

Several of the activists were intrigued by Mr. TrumpÂs suggestion that he would try to wipe out Puerto RicoÂs bloated public debt, but then others noted that other administration officials had quickly dismissed that idea. And they were unanimous in their criticism of Mr. Trump for waiting two weeks before visiting Puerto Rico and about his harsh remarks about the mayor of San Juan, whom he accused of Âpoor leadership.Â

ÂThat was horrible,Â said Zoraida Rios-Andino. ÂHe treated us like a third-world country.Â

Gov. Rick Scott, who has been mentioned as a possible candidate for the United States Senate next year, and Senator Marco Rubio, both Republicans, have been pushing aggressively for assistance for the island and for services within Florida to help those who have been displaced. They are conscious that the antagonism toward the president could have consequences for them.

ÂOne of the reasons you see Rubio and Rick Scott racing to Puerto Rico is they realize the potential danger of this bashing of the mayor for Florida Republicans,Â said Susan MacManus, a professor at the University of South Florida who has studied the stateÂs Latino vote.

Ultimately, the impact Puerto Ricans have on politics will be up to people like Esteban Garces, state director of Mi Familia Vota, who has been working in the state since 2012 and said his group had registered more than 65,000 voters since then.

Puerto Ricans are American citizens by birth, so registering them is far easier than registering Latino immigrants. His organization has been building a network that will make it easier to register those who come from the island and declare Florida residency. ÂWe have the capacity and the know-how to step up the scale,Â Mr. Garces said.

ÂThis is a defining moment,Â he said. ÂHistorically Cubans have always been thought of as the political powerhouse in Florida, but over the years their concentration has been decreasing. Now, there are almost more Puerto Ricans than Cubans, which will create a dynamic shift in how the Latino vote in Florida goes.Â

It is too soon, he said, to push to register people as they arrive, many stricken by loss. But with a governorÂs race next year, Mr. Garces is preparing to mobilize after the migrants have had time to settle in.

That election, and the presidential election in 2020 if Mr. Trump is on the ballot, will be a referendum in part for Latino voters on how politicians responded to the crisis in Puerto Rico.

ÂThey have a lot of power in their hands with that vote,Â Mr. Garces said. ÂItÂs just a matter of flexing that muscle.Â

WASHINGTON Â Almost from the moment that Islamist militants overran the American consulate and assaulted a C.I.A. annex in Benghazi, Libya, in September 2012, politics consumed the deadly attacks. Using the event as partisan ammunition, Republicans and conservative media outlets sought to make the cityÂs name synonymous with Democratic scandal.

But beginning on Monday in a federal courthouse in Washington, prosecutors will put forward an account that focuses not on politics, but squarely on the attacks themselves and a man they say bears direct responsibility: Ahmed Abu Khattala.

ÂThe Benghazi case has been burdened with a lot of politics; now it is the turn of law enforcement, national security professionals and prosecutors to show the world what really happened,Â said Carlos T. Fernandez, a former senior F.B.I. counterterrorism official whose agents investigated the attacks.

The trial will serve as the latest test of the civilian court systemÂs ability to handle foreign terrorism suspects captured by Special Operations commandos under battlefield conditions, rather than subjecting them to military detention and prosecution.

Prosecutors are expected to portray Mr. Khatalla as a ringleader of a local militia of Islamic extremists who was angry about the American presence in Benghazi and played a leading role in directing the attacks. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens was killed, as were three other Americans: Sean Smith, a State Department information officer, and two C.I.A. operatives, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods. Mr. Stevens, who died of smoke inhalation, was the first American ambassador killed in an attack since 1979.

During the attacks, militants wielding machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades breached the walls and set fire to the consulate, then used mortars in an attack on the C.I.A. base about a mile away. Later, Mr. Khatalla gave interviews to Western journalists, acknowledging that he was at the consulate but denying involvement in the violence.

Even though he was widely known to be a primary suspect, he made no attempt to flee Benghazi. He was later captured, interrogated for days aboard the warship New York as it steamed across the ocean, then charged with multiple counts, including murder, destruction of federal buildings and providing support to terrorism. His trial is expected to take about five weeks, and include surveillance video clips and eyewitness testimony reconstructing the attacks, the role he is accused of playing and his eventual capture.

Mr. Khatalla, who faces a potential sentence of life in prison if convicted, has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers will most likely try to cast suspicion on others who were at the consulate that night to deflect blame from their client. The Justice Department has charged at least a dozen people under seal in the attacks, officials say.

The attacks crystallized LibyaÂs descent into chaos after the 2011 Arab Spring uprising, which, with help from NATO air power, had toppled the countryÂs longtime dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.

Conservatives focused on such issues as why early Obama administration talking points inaccurately portrayed the attacks as a spontaneous protest rather than a premeditated assault. In time, the Benghazi attacks came to serve as shorthand for failures by Hillary Clinton, then the nationÂs top diplomat, and President Barack Obama. Congress conducted multiple oversight investigations into Benghazi, including an inquiry by a House select committee that questioned Mrs. Clinton for 11 hours of public testimony about such topics as her use of a private email server while secretary of state.

Mr. KhatallaÂs trial will be closely watched, not only because of the notoriety of the attacks Â Hollywood dramatized them in the film Â13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of BenghaziÂ Â but also for its implications for national security legal policy. The case is a particularly high-profile instance of using civilian court to prosecute a foreign terrorism suspect captured abroad.

A recurring debate has emerged over whether such suspects should instead be held and interrogated at the military prison at GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba, then prosecuted before the military commissions system there.

ÂThere are dozens upon dozens of terrorism-related cases, but every now and then there is one that has the potential to reframe how people think about the efficacy of civilian prosecution,Â said Robert Chesney, a University of Texas law professor who specializes in national security. ÂThis has all the hallmarks of such a case.Â

In June 2014, the military launched its operation Â code-named Greenbrier River, according to former military officials Â to snatch Mr. Khattala. With the help of an informant, he was lured to a small villa on the coastline of Libya, an ideal spot to ambush him because of its isolation. As he stepped into the house, a team of operators from the ArmyÂs elite Delta Force and an agent from the F.B.I.Âs hostage rescue team rushed to grab him.

Mr. Khattala, who had a handgun, resisted for several minutes Â kicking and punching furiously Â but was quickly subdued and handcuffed, according to court records. He was outfitted with earmuffs, blindfolded and gagged. He was then taken to the beach, where Navy SEALs whisked him on a boat to an American warship. Before reaching the vessel, Mr. Khattala repeatedly asked his captors: ÂWhy me? Why me?Â

On board, Mr. Khattala received three staples to the top of his head because of an injury he suffered during the capture.

Mr. KhatallaÂs detention facility aboard the ship consisted of four roughly 8-foot cubes and a toilet. The lights were kept on 24 hours a day for security reasons. During the 13-day voyage across the ocean, Mr. Khatalla was interrogated for five days without being advised of his so-called Miranda rights to remain silent or consult with a defense lawyer. Then, after a two-day break, new interrogators from the F.B.I. delivered the Miranda warning and questioned him again.

Mr. Khatalla waived his rights and continued to talk to the new team, and prosecutors intend to use what he said to them as evidence against him. His defense lawyers later said that his waiver should not count because he was still under coercive circumstances, but the judge presiding over the case, Christopher Cooper, rejected the defense motion to suppress those statements, ruling that the waiver was voluntary and allowing the evidence to be used.

For prosecutors, the ruling cleared their biggest potential obstacle to a conviction in civilian court.

Republicans criticized the Obama administration for putting Mr. Khattala in the criminal justice system after his capture, rather than taking him to GuantÃ¡namo, at least for a more prolonged interrogation without a Miranda warning and defense lawyer.

Still, it is not clear that Mr. Khatalla would have been eligible for a war crimes trial; even though he shares the ideology of Al Qaeda, an organization with which the United States is at war, he is not believed to have meaningful links to that organization.

Adding to the complexity of the case, the F.B.I. was not able to swiftly secure the crime scene and conduct a typical forensic investigation because Benghazi was too dangerous.

The trial also comes as the Trump administration is weighing what to do with an American citizen accused of fighting for the Islamic State before surrendering to a Syrian militia around Sept. 12.

The militia handed the prisoner over to the American military. The Pentagon has not revealed the detaineeÂs name or location, but the International Committee for the Red Cross and the Defense Department acknowledged last week that the United States had provided a formal notice and was arranging for a visit by the humanitarian group.

The law governing military commissions at the wartime prison at GuantÃ¡namo precludes American citizens from being tried in that system, and it is disputed whether Islamic State detainees, as opposed to members of Al Qaeda, may be lawfully held there in indefinite detention without trial.

Although Mr. Khatalla is not an American citizen, the Obama administration chose not to send him to GuantÃ¡namo both because it was trying to close the prison and because he lacked strong ties to Al Qaeda.

A jury trial in a terrorism case nonetheless carries risk. In the 2010 trial of Ahmed Ghailani, a former GuantÃ¡namo detainee charged with Al QaedaÂs 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa, he was convicted of conspiring to destroy American buildings but acquitted of 284 other charges, including every murder count.

Even though the case qualified as a victory for the prosecution Â the single conviction was enough for the judge to impose a life sentence Â critics of using civilian trials for terrorism cases portrayed the result as a disaster.

Invoking the Ghailani case, Mr. Chesney said of Mr. KhattalaÂs trial, ÂIf it were to go wrong in some way for the government, it will certainly be seized upon by critics of the criminal justice process as a tool for counterterrorism Â notwithstanding the endless number of successful Justice Department terrorism prosecutions that have already occurred.Â

The driver was drunk, the police said, his blood alcohol content nearly three times the legal limit. One of his victims was an N.F.L. linebacker who was just reaching his prime.

But on Tuesday, two days after the crash, it was the driverÂs immigration status that moved President Trump to post his first tweet of the morning.

Decades of research have shown that immigrants are less prone to commit crimes and to be incarcerated than people born in the United States. But more and more lately, Mr. Trump has been using individual criminal cases to advance an argument that illegal immigration, as well as many forms of legal immigration, is dangerous to Americans and must be curbed.

Now the White House, along with some Republicans in Congress, is arguing that any deal to protect hundreds of thousands of young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation must include provisions to tighten border security and roll back some types of legal immigration.

HereÂs how a linebackerÂs death became part of that debate.

Edwin Jackson, a linebacker from Atlanta, was the ColtsÂ third-leading tackler of the 2016 season before sitting out 2017 with an injury. He was riding in an Uber car driven by the crashÂs second victim, Jeffrey Monroe, who was from nearby Avon, Ind.

The car had stopped along the side of Interstate 70 in Indianapolis so Mr. Monroe could get out to help Mr. Jackson, who was sick, when Manuel Orrego-SavalaÂs Ford truck drove onto the emergency shoulder and plowed into them, the Indiana State Police said. He struck both men, heaving one of their bodies into the highwayÂs center lane.

When a state trooper saw the wreckage on the side of the road shortly after, he headed toward the crash, hitting the man lying in the middle of the highway in the process, the police said. (The police did not say which man the trooper struck.)

Mr. Monroe, 54, and Mr. Jackson, 26, were pronounced dead at the scene. Mr. Orrego-Savala was arrested as he tried to flee on foot.

The state police said that Mr. Orrego-Savala was living in the United States illegally, having been deported to Guatemala twice before. He had been convicted of driving under the influence in California in 2005, and his record also showed Âmany otherÂ misdemeanor convictions and arrests in Indiana and California, said Nicole Alberico, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal immigration agency.

I.C.E. has formally asked the county jail where Mr. Orrego-Savala, who was using the alias Alex Cabrera Gonsales, is being held to continue detaining him for federal immigration agents. But before he is deported again he is likely to be prosecuted locally for causing the fatal crash, and federal prosecutors said on Tuesday that they had charged him with illegally re-entering the country after being deported.

The Trump administration regularly highlights crimes committed by immigrants, especially those who came here in ways Mr. Trump has vowed to curtail. Last week, Mr. Trump used the biggest stage available Â the State of the Union address Â to warn of the dangers of MS-13, a gang associated with young Central American migrants, drawing criticism that he had, once again, made immigrants out to be little more than criminals.

Besides a border wall and other measures to discourage illegal immigration, the president wants to curb two forms of legal immigration. He wants to end the diversity visa lottery, which offers people from countries that do not normally send large numbers of immigrants to the United States a chance at a green card, regardless of whether they have special skills or relatives in the United States. The president also wants to restrict family-based immigration, the system that has given millions of visas to relatives of American citizens and permanent residents, in favor of a more merit-based system.

In January, the administration released a report purporting to show that the vast majority of people convicted of international terrorism-related charges since Sept. 11, 2001, were foreign-born. It took pains to highlight cases in which such people came to the country through the diversity visa lottery or because they were related to an American citizen or legal resident. But parts of the report were misleading, and Democrats and others who support immigration were quick to dismiss it for its political tinge.

Last week, in a news release that began with the words, ÂOur current immigration system jeopardizes our national security and puts American communities at risk,Â the White House listed 15 people accused or convicted of terrorism-related crimes who it said had arrived either through the diversity visa lottery or family ties.

The list included two others whose immigration records Mr. Trump amplified on Twitter: Akayed Ullah, a Bangladeshi-born immigrant who tried to detonate a pipe bomb in the New York subway in December, and Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan who killed eight people in a bike lane on the West Side of Manhattan in October.

Several studies, conducted over many years, have concluded that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the United States, and much less likely to be in prison than those born in the United States.

Homeland Security officials have estimated that about 1.9 million noncitizens living in the country, whether legally or illegally, have been convicted of criminal offenses. About 820,000 of those people may be in the country illegally, including about 300,000 with felony convictions, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a research group that has opposed Mr. TrumpÂs proposals to cut immigration.

Experts say the evidence does not show that immigrants are more dangerous than native-born Americans. Among men ages 18 to 49, immigrants were one-half to one-fifth as likely to be incarcerated as those born in the United States, according to census data, though that proportion rises significantly when only federal inmates are counted. Yet about one-third of noncitizen federal inmates are serving time only for immigration-related offenses, such as slipping back into the country after being deported.

But for those who support restricting immigration, another question is whether current immigration laws leave the country vulnerable. Opponents of the diversity visa lottery often cite a report the State DepartmentÂs inspector general issued in 2003, which concluded that the program could be granting green cards to spies, criminals and terrorists.

During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump spoke of family members of people killed by unauthorized immigrants, arguing that their relatives would still be alive if immigrants were not allowed to come illegally to the United States in the first place. Mr. Trump made the case of Kathryn Steinle, who was shot to death by an undocumented immigrant in San Francisco in 2015, into a byword for the dangers of unchecked immigration. After the man who shot her, who claimed it was an accident, was acquitted of manslaughter in November, Mr. Trump renewed his call for the wall.

Some of the most vocal family members have continued to press their cause in Washington, where one such group, Advocates for Victims of Illegal Alien Crime, was meeting with several members of Congress on Tuesday. They said they were planning to mention Mr. JacksonÂs death in their conversations.

Mary Ann Mendoza, the mother of a police officer killed in a drunken-driving crash with an unauthorized immigrant in 2014, said the group was trying to reach Mr. JacksonÂs family to offer support.

ÂWe want to let them know that we are a group of people at AVIAC who have experienced the same sort of loss they have,Â she said. ÂThey can join us in our fight.Â

Mr. JacksonÂs roommate, Chad Bouchez, who said he had been out with Mr. Jackson the night he died, told CBS News that he did not believe Mr. Jackson would have wanted his death politicized.

ÂI donÂt think Edwin would have judged anyone on where they were from or anything else,Â he said.

Â Last yearÂs Super Bowl featured several ads that were political in nature. This year, companies focused more on humor and nostalgia.

Â An ad for the Ram pickup that used a Martin Luther King Jr. sermon drew criticism online.

Â Cindy Crawford, Peter Dinklage, Morgan Freeman and Jeff Bezos were among the famous faces featured in ads during the game.

Â The New York Times provided live, drive-by-drive updates and analysis from Super Bowl LII.

As the Super Bowl headed into its final quarter, the ads continued to fluctuate between funny and somber. The N.F.L.Âs own ad featuring the New York GiantsÂ Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. re-enacting moves inspired by the movie ÂDirty DancingÂ was a hit, as was AmazonÂs Alexa ad, which included Cardi B, Rebel Wilson and the companyÂs chief executive, Jeff Bezos.

ÂThereÂs definitely a humanitarian theme that is running through the spots,Â said Margaret Johnson, chief creative officer of the agency Goodby Silverstein & Partners, which created the Doritos-Mountain Dew ad. ÂThat and humor seem to be the two themes of the night.Â

While there were no commercials connected to the #MeToo movement, some still saw progress when it came to the role of gender in Super Bowl ads.

ÂI was just thinking that one thing I havenÂt seen are those ads that objectify women, which is refreshing,Â Ms. Johnson said. ÂAnd guess what? ThereÂs still funny stuff on the air. WeÂre making progress.Â

Still, some wished that there was more humor.

ÂItÂs really a pretty lame year,Â said Marianne Malina, president of the agency GSD&M in Austin, Tex. ÂWhen the TV promos for the Olympics and ÂThe VoiceÂ and the N.F.L. and Justin Timberlake overshadow a lot, that says everything.Â

Ms. Malina pointed out that that was a shift from the political tone of last year.

ÂItÂs an interesting insight into just the level of risk that people are comfortable with right now,Â Ms. Malina said. ÂLast year, people had a very strong response, and now, a year later, people are confused. EveryoneÂs trying to get their head around all the things that are going on, so you can see how maybe the risk dial goes down.Â

ÂBut in reality,Â she added, Âthe risk dial maybe needs to go up.Â

Verizon was among the brands that took a somber route. Its ad showed images of rescue situations and carried the voices of people thanking emergency workers, ending with the words: ÂThey answer the call. Our job is to make sure they can get it.Â

ÂIn a culture and a climate where itÂs hard to find any kind of positive news out there at the moment, it felt like something we wanted to really lean into and take on a very different message,Â said Andrew McKechnie, VerizonÂs chief creative officer.

The blowback was swift for Ram after the carmaker used a sermon given by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as the voice-over for one of its ads.

The general sentiment: Did it really just use Dr. KingÂs words about the value of service to sell trucks?

ÂMLK wanted equal rights and for me to buy a Dodge Ram,Â one Twitter user wrote. Another wrote: ÂBlack people cant kneel and play football but MLK should be used to sell trucks during the super bowl. Unbelievable.Â

ÂItÂs the wrong mistake to make given everything thatÂs going on in the U.S. right now,Â said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern UniversityÂs Kellogg School of Management. ÂThereÂs so much emotion right now around race in this country that this was a high-risk move, and clearly itÂs not going over very well.

ÂI think it was well intentioned, but theyÂre going to have a lot of explaining to do,Â Mr. Calkins added. ÂThey did not release this ahead of time, so they went for the surprise. They got that, but at the same time, they now have a big problem with feedback and people being upset.Â

Adding to the disconnect, the sermon in question, delivered exactly 50 years ago, touched on the danger of overspending on items like cars and discussed why people Âare so often taken by advertisers.Â

Ram approached Dr. KingÂs estate about using his voice in the commercial, said Eric D. Tidwell, the managing director of Intellectual Properties Management, the licenser of the estate.

ÂOnce the final creative was presented for approval, it was reviewed to ensure it met our standard integrity clearances,Â Mr. Tidwell said in a statement on Sunday night. ÂWe found that the overall message of the ad embodied Dr. KingÂs philosophy that true greatness is achieved by serving others.Â

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles U.S. said in a statement: ÂWe worked closely with the representatives of the Martin Luther King Jr. estate to receive the necessary approvals, and estate representatives were a very important part of the creative process every step of the way.Â

The Super Bowl regularly draws elaborate schemes from advertisers, and this year is no exception. Tourism Australia Â the Australian government agency responsible for attracting international visitors to the country Â decided last April that it would buy a Super Bowl spot as part of a broader campaign geared toward drawing more visitors from North America.

The form it took: a big movie campaign for ÂDundee,Â a sequel to the movie ÂCrocodile Dundee,Â starring the actors Danny McBride and Chris Hemsworth.

The catch: ÂDundeeÂ isnÂt actually being made, despite the entertaining trailers that have been released for the film, its movie website and IMDB page, and a cast introduction video that includes appearances from a host of famous Australians, including Hugh Jackman, Margot Robbie, Isla Fisher and Russell Crowe.

ÂWe did a scan around things like the Grammys and the Academy Awards and other sporting events like the N.B.A. Finals and the World Series, but the event that really stops this country is the Super Bowl,Â said John OÂSullivan, the managing director of Tourism Australia. ÂItÂs such a spectacle, right? If you look at it from a foreignerÂs point of view, itÂs this massive event which I think surpasses things like the Grand Slams in tennis and the Champions League final.Â

North America is the second-most-valuable market for Australian tourism after mainland China, and one that the agency has decided to focus on in the last six months, Mr. OÂSullivan said. While many people want to visit Australia, he said, the trick for the country is moving up from a Âbucket listÂ destination to a place that people will go in the near future.

The concept for the campaign was created by the ad agency Droga5, whose founder, David Droga, is Australian. Content tied to the pretend movie will morph after the Super Bowl ad and will continue to use Danny McBride and Chris Hemsworth, Mr. Droga said.

ÂThe beauty is thereÂs also a lot of content that moves with Chris and Danny thatÂs sort of them exploring the country as friends Â as an Aussie showing around a mate,Â he said.

Mr. Droga also noted that the campaign for ÂDundeeÂ benefited from the support of ÂAussiewoodÂ stars like Mr. Jackman and Ms. Robbie, who worked on it for Ânothing.Â

ÂIf we had to pay commercial rights for those people,Â then it Âwould be the most expensive ad in the Super Bowl maybe ever,Â he said.

One final Super Bowl connection: Mr. OÂSullivan noted that he spent a year of high school in Lebanon, Pa., making him a Philadelphia Eagles fan.

ÂTypically, you see the great work is front-loaded, and I guess my hope is that the better work is coming,Â Wendy Clark, the chief executive of DDB North America and a former marketing executive at Coca-Cola, said at the start of the gameÂs second quarter. ÂAt the end of the day, a Super Bowl ad is about epic, over-the-top production value,Â and the first quarter Âwas a little quiet in the end.Â

Still, Ms. Clark was a fan of the Tide ad and the Doritos-Mountain Dew ad featuring Peter Dinklage and Morgan Freeman lip-syncing to Missy Elliott and Busta Rhymes.

ÂThe complete flip to Morgan Freeman, itÂs just so good,Â she said. ÂThereÂs a surprise aspect there, and itÂs really enjoyable watching those two characters rap Â the complete 180 is fantastic.Â

She added, ÂFunctionally, youÂre also thinking, ÂOh, my God, I would eat those together.Â

Tide drew the laughs heading into the second quarter with a meta commercial starring David Harbour (ÂStranger ThingsÂ) that showed a slew of setups for other ads before interrupting itself with, ÂNo, itÂs a Tide ad.Â

ÂI want to see how they bring it to life and on social,Â Ms. Clark said. ÂI assume theyÂre going to comment on every single ad now from their handle.Â (ThatÂs @Tide on Twitter.)

Stella Artois ran a commercial featuring Matt Damon urging people to buy limited-edition chalices in order to give years of clean water to people in developing countries through a partnership with Water.org, which works for safe water and sanitation. That was joined by a somber commercial from Budweiser, set to the song ÂStand by Me,Â focused on the companyÂs efforts to deliver cans of water to people affected by natural disasters.

ÂMillennials like brands that link themselves to a social cause,Â Charles R. Taylor, a professor of marketing at the Villanova University School of Business, said. ÂWhat Stella Artois is doing with Water.org, I think, is really smart.Â

Still, Stella ArtoisÂs effort spurred some skepticism, with news outlets fact-checking the adÂs claims and some viewers asking why Stella Artois didnÂt simply donate the cost of the commercial to Water.org. The company, through a public relations firm, declined to say whether it had paid Mr. Damon for the appearance.

Pringles is running its first Super Bowl ad, starring the comedian Bill Hader, as it tries to popularize the notion of ÂstackingÂ chips with different flavors to arrive at a new, artificially flavored snack. (And, presumably, to encourage people to buy more than one pack of the chips at a time.)

Yuvraj Arora, a senior vice president of marketing at Kellogg, explained how to use the process to approximate the taste of chicken wings. ÂYou take barbecue Pringles, buffalo ranch Pringles and ranch Pringles and you get a chicken-wing-like experience without the mess,Â he said.

Mr. Arora noted that the way the millennial generation interacts with food, especially on social media, was an inspiration for the idea.

ÂFood is so central to millennialsÂ lifestyle,Â he said. ÂAll around, you see thereÂs mashups, new flavor experiences and a number of unique flavors.Â

In an era of cord-cutting and ad-skipping, the Super Bowl is a sweet salve for the nationÂs marketers. ThereÂs no bigger stage for advertisers Â last yearÂs game drew more than 111 million viewers Â and thatÂs why theyÂre willing to shell out millions of dollars to be on it for 30 seconds.

Last year, commercials with social and political messages stole the show, but this yearÂs crop of advertisers seemed to steer clear of such commentary and aimed for laughs and nostalgia.

Of course, theyÂre paying the same high-ticket prices: The average cost of a 30-second ad in the Super Bowl is more than $5 million this year, according to ad buyers, roughly in line with last year. And that doesnÂt count all the expenses tied to making and promoting an ad, like the star power. Cindy Crawford, Peter Dinklage and Danny DeVito are among the famous faces who will make commercial appearances this year.

While some ads focused on philanthropy, the tone seemed to have shifted from last year, when Airbnb and 84 Lumber ran spots that were viewed as responses to President TrumpÂs rhetoric on immigration and Audi broadcast a commercial advocating equal pay for women. Some industry experts had expected at least one major ad focused on women this year, perhaps tied to the #MeToo movement.

ÂIÂm a little bit surprised,Â Charles R. Taylor, a professor of marketing at the Villanova University School of Business, said. ÂSome of the best ads over the last 10 years have focused on female empowerment, like the Audi daughter ad.Â

Women are generally much less visible in Super Bowl ads than men, even as Nielsen data shows that women were 47 percent of the audience for last yearÂs game. Mr. Taylor, who recently studied Super Bowl ads from 2008 to 2017, found that 76 percent of the commercials showed a man as a principal character, while 43 percent featured a woman as a principal character.

Susan Credle, the global chief creative officer at the agency FCB, said Super Bowl advertisers may be Âconcerned about looking opportunistic versus supportive.Â And humor, she noted, was particularly appealing given the social and political climate.

ÂSometimes when the world is troubled or America is feeling a little Â well, I wouldnÂt say it was an up 2017 for everybody Â I think there is a tendency to want to balance out the energy,Â Ms. Credle said. ÂLightheartedness and a little fun and joy is probably a good antidote to the reality that weÂre sitting in.Â

Fans of HBOÂs ÂGame of ThronesÂ have been buzzing about a commercial for Doritos and Mountain Dew that stars the actors Peter Dinklage and Morgan Freeman, as well as the musicians Missy Elliott and Busta Rhymes. The brands, owned by Pepsi, cast Mr. Dinklage to represent fire, for a new spicy Doritos flavor, while Mr. Morgan plays ice for a new kind of Mountain Dew.

Greg Lyons, the chief marketing officer of PepsiÂs North American beverage unit, said the casting was not a reference to Mr. DinklageÂs ÂGame of ThronesÂ character, who advises a queen who owns dragons. The actor, he said, is Âfiery on his own.Â

Mr. Lyons said, ÂHe was in ÂElfÂ Â he was pretty fiery in that as well.Â

In another kind of pop-culture moment, Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, who has become far more visible in recent months at Hollywood and charity events, will appear in his first ad for the company, which promotes its Echo device.

While it has never been easier for advertisers to reach vast numbers of people around the world, thanks to the internet, the lure of the Super Bowl is the one huge audience it provides. Advertisers spent a combined $534 million on ads before, during and after the game last year, according to the research firm Kantar. The company said that the roughly $5 million a 30-second commercial cost last year compared to $2.5 million for 30 seconds in the National Football Conference championship game and $1.9 million for the same time in the Academy Awards.

ÂItÂs a finite amount of inventory,Â Gibbs Haljun, managing director of media investment at GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP. ÂThereÂs only one game, itÂs only on once a year, the ratings are relatively stable and it is what it is.Â

Still, it appeared that NBC was selling at least some spots down to the wire, as illustrated by a last-minute buy from Wix.com that the company announced on Friday. In January, Wix.com was promoting its decision to sit out of this yearÂs game and arranging press interviews with its chief marketing officer about alternative plans for the money.

NBC said in an email late Friday that it had sold all of its ads for the game.

The network, which is owned by Comcast, has had the dual challenge this year of selling ads for both the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics, which will begin on Friday.

ÂI canÂt remember the last time that occurred,Â Mr. Haljun said, Âso this is kind of an odd challenge for them and continues to make the negotiations a little more interesting and robust.Â
