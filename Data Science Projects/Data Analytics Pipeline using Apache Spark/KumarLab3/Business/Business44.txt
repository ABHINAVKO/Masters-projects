Good morning. 

Here’s what you need to know:

• In his first State of the Union address, President Trump called for Democrats’ help in addressing immigration and rebuilding U.S. infrastructure. Here’s our wrap-up of the speech Tuesday night.

The president also hailed the “extraordinary success” of his administration’s first year, and stayed uncharacteristically on script. Few new policy proposals emerged.

Here’s a 90-second version of the 80-minute speech, as well as an annotated transcript. And a panel of our journalists provided live commentary.

• We also checked the facts behind 19 of Mr. Trump’s claims.

• One of President Trump’s biggest selling points on Tuesday was the surging economy. But selling himself to the American people is tougher, as only 37 percent approve of the job he is doing, our chief White House correspondent writes.

“Amazing,” “gloomy,” “well-confected” or “way too long.” Reaction to Mr. Trump’s address varied from one pundit to the next. Our own chief television critic’s assessment: “Someone switched the usual president with decaf.”

One standout at the address: Melania Trump, who has stayed largely out of the limelight in recent weeks.

• Representative Joseph Kennedy  provided the Democratic response on Tuesday. Here’s a transcript and video of the speech.

• It’s the most-discussed document in Washington: a secret memo that is said to bolster the Republican argument that biased law enforcement officials are out to sabotage President Trump.

Democrats say it’s a thinly disguised attempt to undermine the Russia investigation by Robert Mueller, the special counsel. Here’s  our overview.

On Tuesday, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, said Mr. Mueller’s inquiry “should be allowed to take its course.” But as a matter of political reality, the memo has everything to do with defending Mr. Trump, one of our Washington correspondents writes.

• Separately, the Trump administration has managed this week to upset people in both Washington and Moscow with its handling of a new law intended to punish the Kremlin for interference in the 2016 U.S. election.

• It’s a threat that will surpass anything a major city has faced since World War II or the Sept. 11 attacks, the South African government warns.

Cape Town, a city of four million, has been hit by a three-year drought and will be forced to turn off taps in homes and businesses within a few months.

• “Nature isn’t particularly willing to compromise,” a former government official said. “And if you haven’t prepared for it, you’ll get hammered.”

To celebrate one year of The Daily, the host and producers reflect on the pleasures and surprises of the podcast — and what’s to come.

• Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase plan to form a health care company to serve their employees in the U.S., a project that could disrupt the industry.

However, health care experts suggested we temper expectations, not least because this has been tried before.

• The tax overhaul has prompted hundreds of employers to share savings with workers. Here’s how they’re doing it.

• The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged today at Janet Yellen’s last meeting as chairwoman.

• Eastman Kodak, the 130-year-old photo company, is dabbling in cryptocurrency. It either hopes to revolutionize digital rights management or is trying to make a quick buck, our columnist writes.

Separately, Facebook said on Tuesday that it would ban all ads for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, citing “misleading or deceptive promotional practices.”

• Turmoil at The Los Angeles Times is the latest setback for the city itself, which has long suffered from a lack of civic institutions.

• U.S. stocks were down on Tuesday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today.

Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.

• Figuring out how to rebuild after infidelity can result in a stronger relationship.

• Here’s where to stream this year’s Oscar-nominated films.

• Order delivery and make an easy chocolate fudge for dessert.

• Hawaii alert wasn’t accidental

The state employee who sent a false warning of an incoming ballistic missile this month thought there was an actual threat, officials said on Tuesday. He had confused drills with real-world events twice before, and has been fired.

• We’re looking for new voices

The Times is seeking five writers for a newsletter for college students and people early in their careers.

Here are the details about the positions. But hurry: The deadline to apply is Friday.

• Coming of age on the big screen

Saoirse Ronan (“Lady Bird”) and Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name”) have been nominated for Oscars.

The young actors talked to us about their roles, handling the pressure of awards season and the #MeToo movement.

• Best of late-night TV

Stephanie Clifford, the former porn actress known as Stormy Daniels, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel’s show, where she neither denied nor confirmed having had an affair with President Trump.

• Quotation of the day

“This, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American dream.”

— President Trump, in his State of the Union address.

• The Times, in other words

Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles.

“Milkshake duck” just missed a spot in the Oxford Dictionaries, but the phrase was honored this month by Macquarie Dictionary in Australia, which declared it the word of the year for 2017.

Confused? “Even if you don’t know the word, you know the phenomenon,” the committee said in its announcement.

The phrase describes when a person’s 15 minutes of fame are followed by an abrupt fall from grace when distasteful misdeeds are unearthed. In many ways, the committee said, that term captured the events of the past year.

The Australian cartoonist Ben Ward, using the Twitter account @pixelatedboat, wrote an absurd tweet in 2016 about the phenomenon, and it raced across the internet last year.

The joke poked at the tendency of social media to accelerate the cycle of adulation and backlash, Mr. Ward told us last summer, when we analyzed the meme’s meteoric rise. “I didn’t mean it to mock anyone — I’m as susceptible to it as anyone else is,” Mr. Ward added.

Isabella Kwai contributed reporting.

FRONT PAGE

An article on Wednesday about President Trump’s rally in Phoenix referred incorrectly in some copies to the destroyer John S. McCain. It was named for Senator John McCain’s grandfather and father — John S. McCain Sr. and John S. McCain Jr., both Navy admirals; it was not named after the Arizona senator.

INTERNATIONAL

An article on Wednesday about similarities between President Trump’s strategy on Afghanistan and proposals made by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. quoted incorrectly from Mr. Trump’s speech on Monday night about Afghanistan. In a reference to terrorists, he said, “These killers need to know they have nowhere to hide,” not “no place” to hide.

BUSINESS DAY

An article on Wednesday about the future of Fiat Chrysler quoted incorrectly from comments by Kristin Dziczek, an analyst at the Center for Automotive Research. Referring to Fiat Chrysler’s debt, she said, “That does not bode well for investing in future product.” She did not say that the debt does bode well for future investments.

•

An article on Wednesday about a partnership between Walmart and Google misstated the role of the Google Assistant, the artificially intelligent software assistant, in the relationship with Walmart. The eventual plan is for Walmart customers to be able to buy products using the Google Assistant; customers cannot do that now.

•

An article on Tuesday about Sempra Energy’s winning the bidding for Energy Future Holdings misstated an outcome for a losing bidder, Berkshire Hathaway. It is not entitled to a $270 million breakup fee.

SCIENCE TIMES

An article on Tuesday about the accomplishments of the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 space missions misstated the date on which the PBS documentary “The Farthest” was broadcast. It was shown Wednesday night; it had not already aired at the time the article was published.

OBITUARIES

An obituary on Wednesday about the playwright, novelist and screenwriter Janusz Glowacki, using information from his family, misstated the year of his marriage to Olena Leonenko. It was 2014, not 2015. Because of an editing error, an accompanying picture caption misspelled the original surname of Mr. Glowacki’s first wife, Ewa. As the obituary correctly noted, it is Zadrzynska, not Zadrzyska. And the obituary misstated, in some copies, the year of the Andrzej Wajda film “Walesa: Man of Hope,” for which Mr. Glowacki wrote the screenplay. It was 2013, not 2003.

•

An obituary on Sunday about the architect Gunnar Birkerts omitted an architect whose work inspired Mr. Birkerts. Besides Eero Saarinen, Mr. Birkerts was also inspired by Eliel Saarinen, the father of Eero.
