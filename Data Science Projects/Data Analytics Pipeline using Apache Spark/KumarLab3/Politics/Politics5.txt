MONTGOMERY, Ala. Â ÂI donÂt think you can compare this one with anything,Â said Bill Baxley, 76, whose first foray into Alabama state politics was as attorney general nearly five decades ago.

ÂI havenÂt seen in my lifetime Â a long time, IÂm 83 going on 84 Â one this unique,Â said Senator Richard C. Shelby, who was first elected to the State Legislature in 1970 and is now the dean of the Alabama congressional delegation.

ÂNever seen anything like this,Â said Glen Browder, 74, a former congressman, during whose political career different Alabama governors were convicted of bribery, brought down by sex scandal and indicted on a charge of stealing money to buy fancy shower stalls and a riding lawn mower.

The special Senate election here, to be decided Tuesday, has made for one wild and ugly campaign season. It was never going to be afternoon tea, but with the airing of allegations in November that Roy S. Moore, the Republican nominee, had hounded and molested teenage girls when he was in his 30s, the race tightened Â and the dialogue went south.

Mr. Moore has gone about creating a real-life political science experiment, testing whether last yearÂs presidential campaign was an anomaly or whether voters remain just as willing to shrug off truth-stretching, multiple charges of sexual misconduct and incendiary speech.

While Republicans in Washington have fruitlessly sought any way to exorcise Mr. Moore from the race, alarmed that he would imperil their narrow Senate majority, their nominee has all but laughed at his own party.

In the last few months, he has implied that the liberal Jewish billionaire George Soros was going to hell, warned in a tweet of ÂDemocrat operativesÂ who are ÂREGISTERING THOUSANDS OF FELONSÂ Â with a link to a story that pictured a pair of black men with paperwork Â and told an African-American attendee at one of his events that America was last great when families were intact during the slavery era. That follows claims he made in previous years that Muslims should not be allowed to hold office and that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.

When Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. TrumpÂs former chief strategist, appeared at a rally for Mr. Moore near the Gulf Coast last week, Mr. MooreÂs Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, tweeted: ÂWe donÂt need an outside agitator like Steve Bannon carpetbagging in Alabama,Â invoking loaded phrases from the civil rights movement and Reconstruction in a single sentence.

ÂTheyÂre pulling out all the old classics for this one,Â said Gordon Harvey, a history professor at Jacksonville State University in Alabama.

While Mr. Jones has not said anything nearly as incendiary as Mr. Moore has, he has attempted some political jujitsu amid the campaignÂs racial politics, sending out a mailer featuring an African-American that read: ÂThink if a black man went after high school girls anyone would try to make him a senator?Â

No, Mr. Browder said, he had simply never seen so many volatile elements packed into a political moment. Then he thought for a minute.

ÂI see parallels with one,Â he said. ÂGeorge Wallace.Â

Wallace, the fiery segregationist governor, comes up often here these days. He was by turns an avid boxer, a circuit judge with lofty ambitions, a state leader who blatantly flouted federal authority, a symbol of defiance to the direction of the national culture, a hero to many rural and small-town whites and a politician who ran national campaigns on a promise to Âsend them a messageÂ Â all descriptions that perfectly fit Mr. Moore.

Mr. Wallace was a Democrat, and his use of race was far more overt and central. Yet when political veterans are pushed to come up with analogous races, they often turn to WallaceÂs successful 1970 run for governor, where he took on, as a national newspaper column put it, Âan unholy coalition of the Republican and Democratic national parties, militant blacks and country club millionaires, the White House and Alabama liberals.Â Aside from the White House, at least since President Trump endorsed his candidacy, this is much the same crowd that Mr. Moore has taken on.

Still, those who knew Wallace well are quick to point out that the messages may be delivered in much the same style, but the messengers are not so alike.

ÂThereÂs a major difference,Â said former Gov. Jim Folsom, a Democrat whose father, the two-term governor ÂBig JimÂ Folsom, was a mentor to a young Wallace.

The elder Folsom elevated an Alabama tradition of tub-thumping economic populism in a state dominated for much of its history by a coterie of wealthy planters and industrialists, known as the Big Mules. While Folsom railed against the elite-owned ÂlyinÂ newspapers,Â much like Mr. Moore and right-wing populists today, he championed women and blacks along with poor whites.

Wallace followed FolsomÂs lead until he discovered that a moderate line on race had become a liability in Alabama electoral politics Â and then switched to become a fire-breathing segregationist.

ÂThe major difference,Â Mr. Folsom said, Âis that Roy Moore, good or bad or whatever you think, has always been genuine in his positions.Â

While Wallace championed a brand of patriotism attuned to the grievances of angry whites, Mr. MooreÂs positions Â that, for instance, the United States might be Âthe focus of evilÂ in the world because it allows same-sex marriage Â show someone dialed in more to fervent evangelicals than the broader conservative electorate.

ÂWallace certainly was willing to use the school prayer issue, but by and large he never mentioned the fact he was a lifelong Methodist, never mentioned his faith on the stump,Â said Dan T. Carter, a historian who wrote one of the leading Wallace biographies.

Since the first women accused Mr. Moore of misconduct in The Washington Post, Mr. Moore has kept a light schedule and largely avoided interaction with the news media, a strategy that would have never occurred to Wallace, who relished the political fray and would gleefully joust with out-of-town reporters.

Still, what the two may have most in common are their fans and their enemies.

ÂWhen you look at his followers,Â said John Knight, a black Alabama state representative who grew up in segregated Montgomery, ÂtheyÂre the same people that were energized by Wallace.Â

The same people are outraged, too.

Upper-class, typically Republican neighborhoods Âwhere the rich folks live in the suburbs up across the mountain from Birmingham,Â as Wallace described the enclave of Mountain Brook during that epic 1970 race, are now crowded with white ÂDoug Jones for SenateÂ signs. To talk to many residents of these neighborhoods is to inevitably find two attitudes: assurances that they will be voting for Mr. Jones and a fatalistic certitude that, of course, Mr. Moore will win.

Thomas T. Gallion III, a Montgomery lawyer whose father was the stateÂs attorney general, voiced the often unstated perspective of AlabamaÂs elite as to why Mr. Moore was viable.

ÂThe rest of the state is in a time warp,Â he said. ÂThey never progressed out of the Â50s. They donÂt think. ItÂs sad.Â

Yet as with Alabama populist campaigns past, Moore backers are most eager to remind voters how many forces outside the state are pulling for Mr. Jones.

It is Âthe language that works,Â Mr. Carter said. ÂIf you can tag somebody an outsider, youÂre two-thirds of the way there in Alabama.Â

This is an age-old Southern populist tactic, added Mickey Griffin, a real estate executive who was the political director on WallaceÂs 1972 and 1976 presidential bids.

ÂIt goes back to the Civil War, it goes back to Reconstruction,Â he said. ÂThe big thing down here is that folks feel like the rest of the country is making fun of them.Â

Mr. Griffin does not see Mr. Moore as Âanywhere close to being a George Wallace,Â but he sees him trying to make the same appeal to a fighting instinct and umbrage at being looked down upon.

In the midst of a two-hour phone conversation about the Wallace era and the current campaign, Mr. Griffin got a call from a friend on the other line. ÂWhat do you think about Roy Moore?Â he asked, and then laughed at the response. ÂÂHeÂs an embarrassment to the state of Alabama following in a long line of embarrassments,ÂÂ Mr. Griffin reported the friend as saying. ÂÂBut heÂs our son of a bitch, and IÂm voting for him.ÂÂ

GODA Human HistoryBy Reza AslanIllustrated. 298 pp. Random House. $28.

A word of advice to the religiously curious: DonÂt trust any history of God that has only 171 pages of text. Reza AslanÂs new project, ÂGod: A Human History,Â is aimed at the analytically minded spiritual seeker, the type who hopes to answer deep questions on the divine with study data and tidbits about evolution. But instead of arming readers with interpretive tools and good questions, Aslan tells a highly selective, generalized tale with the goal of proving his own beliefs.

This fits his oeuvre. A professor of creative writing at the University of California, Riverside, Aslan wields words skillfully and speaks elegantly; his ideas are perfectly suited for the internet-video age. He has a knack for tidy arguments: HeÂs perhaps most famous for eviscerating a Fox News host who questioned why Aslan, a Muslim, would want to write ÂZealot,Â his 2013 book about Jesus. Aslan may well be the most talented religious translator of his generation. But in his primed-for-television sureness, he misses an opportunity to engage the many Americans who are searching for new ideas about God. Rather than cherishing the complexity of belief, he chooses spiritual arrogance.

The idea of the book is fairly simple: Human spirituality can be explained in one cohesive, linear story about our universal desire to see ourselves in God. Aslan is skeptical of religion, which he sees as Âlittle more than a ÂlanguageÂ made up of symbols and metaphors.Â HeÂs more interested in Âthe ineffable experience of faith,Â which for him is Âtoo expansive to be defined by any one religious tradition.Â While he claims heÂs not interested in proving or disproving the existence of God, by the end, his metaphysical commitments become clear. He believes God is universal, present in everyone and everywhere, and no more capable of making moral demands on humanity than any person. ÂThe only way I can truly know God is by relying on the only thing I can truly know: myself,Â Aslan writes. It doesnÂt matter whether people believe in God or not, he implies. ÂWe are, every one of us, God.Â

This mix of humanism and pantheism guides AslanÂs narrative choices. He structures the book as a linear progression of faith, moving from animism, or the attribution of a soul to all objects, to monotheism, or the belief in one God. HeÂs deeply interested in the origin of religious impulse, settling on an evolutionary theory: When ancient hunter-gatherers saw gods in the world around them, they were just trying to detect threats, looking for signs of humanlike beings with the ability to harm. An intuitive belief in the soul is ÂhumanityÂs first belief,Â Aslan writes. We are wired to see the divine.

As human civilization evolved, so did peopleÂs worship of humanlike gods, Aslan says. People began to see themselves as Ârulers of nature, gods over the earth,Â he argues, which led to the development of agriculture. Ancient civilizations revered their ancestors and pantheons of gods with human traits; emperors and kings lifted specific gods to rule others in their image. While monotheism emerged in fits and starts, Aslan writes, it finally took hold among the ancient Israelites. He goes on to summarize the first 600 years of Christianity in 17 pages, bringing religious history to its culmination in Islam, Âa kind of doubling down on the very concept of monotheism.Â

ItÂs a convenient story for an author arguing that a single, universal theory can adequately summarize thousands of years of contested history, text and myth. Aslan shows little interest in religious traditions that donÂt fit this pattern, such as Hinduism and Buddhism, which are mentioned only in passing. His history of God barely travels east of the Arabian Sea.

Instead, Aslan bushwhacks his way through intellectual history in pursuit of his point. Ãmile Durkheim, one of the most important early sociologists of religion, is taken down in two paragraphs. Aslan is clearly bothered by what he sees as theological inconsistency, dismissing the Christian notion that GodÂs Trinitarian nature is a mystery and Muslims who donÂt grapple with the ÂparadoxÂ of attributing human qualities to Allah, who is supposed to be distinct from creation. Each successive religion has rendered earlier forms irrelevant, he suggests, ultimately leading to the universalistic revelation he delivers in his book.

Aslan finds this expressed in the mystic tradition that Ârevitalized Islamic theology in the face of orthodox rigidity,Â known as Sufism. ÂAt last,Â he writes, Âwe arrive at the inevitable endpoint of the monotheistic experiment Â God is not the creator of everything that exists. God is everything that exists.Â

ItÂs a slippery play. Aslan self-identifies as a believer, but acknowledges that someone might as well think everything from the Big Bang to the balance of mass and energy Âis all just an accident of atoms.Â After this whole glib race through the history of religion, it turns out Aslan has no taste for religious particularity: textual debates that can animate a lifetime; ritual practices bound by sacred law; theological concepts that are specific to one tradition, rather than common to all.

Aslan spends much of his public life defending Muslims against bigotry, including comments by New Atheists such as Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. But ironically, he seems to share some of their intellectual biases. Like AslanÂs CNN series, ÂBelieverÂ Â canceled in June after he wrote a foul-languaged tweet about President Trump Â ÂGod: A Human HistoryÂ is aggressive atheism tempered and remodeled for the millennial age: doggedly universalistic, obligation-free and relentlessly focused on self-revelation. While Aslan claims to walk alongside the seeker, his orientation is actually the opposite, forgoing humility and spiritual hunger in favor of simplicity and self-righteousness.

Readers searching for God in AslanÂs history will most likely be disappointed. But in this, thereÂs a hidden blessing. Unlike AslanÂs search, theirs will continue once the book is done.
