WASHINGTON Â Few places have seen the National Rifle Association wield its might more effectively than Florida, where it has advanced a sweeping agenda that has made it easier to carry concealed weapons, given gun owners greater leeway to shoot in self-defense and even briefly barred doctors from asking patients about their firearms.

To many of its opponents, that decades-long string of victories is proof that the N.R.A. has bought its political support. But the numbers tell a more complicated story: The organizationÂs political action committee over the last decade has not made a single direct contribution to any current member of the Florida House or Senate, according to campaign finance records.

In Florida and other states across the country, as well as on Capitol Hill, the N.R.A. derives its political influence instead from a muscular electioneering machine, fueled by tens of millions of dollarsÂ worth of campaign ads and voter-guide mailings, that scrutinizes candidates for their views on guns and propels members to the polls.

ÂItÂs really not the contributions,Â said Cleta Mitchell, a former N.R.A. board member. ÂItÂs the ability of the N.R.A. to tell its members: HereÂs whoÂs good on the Second Amendment.Â

Far more than any check the N.R.A. could write, it is this mobilization operation that has made the organization such a challenging adversary for Democrats and gun control advocates Â one that, after the massacre at a school in Parkland, Fla., is struggling to confront an emotional student-led push for new restrictions.

The N.R.A.Âs impact comes, in large part, from the simplicity of the incentives it presents to political candidates: letter grades, based on their record on the Second Amendment, that guide the N.R.A.Âs involvement in elections. Lawmakers who earn an ÂAÂ rating can count on the group not to oppose them when they run for re-election or higher office.

For candidates who earn lower grades, the group deploys a range of blunt-force methods against them. The N.R.A. mails the voter guides to its five million members, displaying images of favored candidates on the front, and some state chapters bombard supporters with emails about coming elections.

The organizationÂs calculation is that its money is better spent on maintaining a motivated base of gun rights supporters than on bankrolling candidates directly.

ÂEveryone wants a simplistic answer, which is they buy votes,Â said Harry L. Wilson, a political scientist at Roanoke College and the author of ÂGuns, Gun Control, and Elections.Â ÂBut it is largely incorrect. The N.R.A.Âs power is more complex than people think.Â

Compared with the towering sums of money donated to House and Senate candidates in the last cycle Â $1.7 billion Â the N.R.A.Âs direct contributions were almost a rounding error.

The N.R.A. directly donated a total of just $1.1 million to candidates for federal office in 2016, with 99 percent of that money going to Republicans, while giving a total of only $309,000 in direct contributions to state legislative candidates in 2016 and 2017, according to tallies by the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks federal donations, and the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which tracks state-level donations.

Those amounts are dwarfed by the largess of other major contributors. Comcast, through its political action committee and its employees, directly donated $12.7 million in the 2016 campaign cycle to federal candidates or political parties, and the committee for Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant, and its employees directly donated nearly $3 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics tallies.

Those numbers are tied to campaign finance reports filed by individual lawmakers. The N.R.A.Âs spending on messages like its voter guides does not need to be disclosed, because it falls into the category of a membership-based group communicating with its members.

When candidates waver in their support for sweeping gun rights, the group does not hesitate to turn on them. After Ted Strickland, a Democrat who earned the N.R.A.Âs endorsement as a candidate for governor of Ohio, backed a ban on assault weapons, the organization spent more than $1.5 million in so-called independent expenditures, like TV ads, to defeat him in a 2016 bid for the Senate.

Ms. Mitchell, a Republican election lawyer who sat on the groupÂs board for nearly a decade, said its record of loyalty to those who stand by it was a cornerstone of its influence. ÂThey know that itÂs not easy, sometimes, to stick with the N.R.A.,Â she said of the groupÂs leadership. ÂAt times like this, itÂs very easy to get stampeded by the media and the left.Â

While the N.R.A. cuts relatively few checks to individual lawmakers Â a fact that has been noted by The Tampa Bay Times, among others Â it does devote tens of millions of dollars to ads backing its preferred candidates or criticizing its opponents, often with vividly alarmist messages about crime and self-defense.

The N.R.A., through its various legal entities, raises money for its political and lobbying efforts and other activities from two primary sources: member dues and contributions from outside supporters, including gun makers like Smith & Wesson and political groups like Freedom Partners, the Koch family-backed organization.

The group has fought to keep the identity of many of its biggest contributors secret, although an audit document filed with the State of North Carolina showed that its total budget was about $420 million in 2016.

The N.R.A. spent $20 million in that yearÂs election cycle on ads and other campaign tactics intended to persuade voters to reject Hillary Clinton and an additional $11 million to support Donald J. Trump Â money that is not marked down as a direct contribution to Mr. Trump, because the N.R.A. spent the cash on its own.

At the state level, the N.R.A. also spends much more on these independent expenditures than on direct contributions to candidates.

Expenditures like these are the area of real growth for the N.R.A.: At the federal and state levels, overall independent spending by the group jumped from $9.3 million in the 2009 election cycle to at least $55 million in 2016, according to an analysis by the National Institute on Money in State Politics that was published on Friday.

ÂIts most precious resource is perhaps the passion and political engagement of its members and its fans,Â said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics.

This type of spending also comes with risks, particularly when the group ventures into so-called purpler parts of the country, where the two parties have similar levels of support. The N.R.A.Âs presence can draw in an increasingly well-funded collection of groups that support gun control, and can sometimes unnerve moderate voters.

Last fall in Virginia, where the N.R.A. is headquartered and once held commanding clout over the state government, Democrats swept all of the stateÂs major offices after campaigning loudly against the organization. The stateÂs attorney general, Mark Herring, a Democrat whom the N.R.A. had targeted for defeat, said the group had insisted on defending a platform that was Âbecoming more and more untenableÂ with voters in the political middle.

ÂThere were parts of the state where they wouldnÂt run their ads because they knew it would drive voters to supporting me,Â Mr. Herring said, adding of the N.R.A.Âs campaign spending: ÂIt did elevate the conversation, the issue, but it was also one that I wanted to talk about.Â

Still, in more rural areas where voters fiercely support gun rights, Democrats have routinely paid a price in recent years for crossing the N.R.A.

In Colorado, where a Democratic-held state government passed new gun regulations after the 2012 massacre at a movie theater in Aurora, the N.R.A. helped bankroll successful recall campaigns against two Democratic lawmakers, including the powerful president of the State Senate.

The former Senate leader, John P. Morse, who lost his seat in 2013 by a margin of 319 votes, said the N.R.A. had played a decisive role in motivating Second Amendment voters in a low-turnout race. After that, Mr. Morse said, Democrats have Ârun like scalded rats from the issue.Â

ÂThey turn out people that already agree with them,Â Mr. Morse said of the N.R.A. ÂThe reason why gun policy is where it is in this country, at this point, is that the rest of us are too lackadaisical.Â

The organization has focused heavily in recent years on high-profile Senate elections in conservative-leaning states that are key to the balance of power in Congress, amassing an imposing record of victories, including that of Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Tom Cotton of Arkansas.

But it has had major losses, too, including in the Senate special election in Alabama late last year, in which it spent money to try to defeat Doug Jones, a Democrat who challenged Roy S. Moore.

Over all, the success rate of the N.R.A. ebbs and flows with political trends. With Mr. Trump on the ballot, candidates it supported directly at the federal level in 2016 won 73 percent of the time, while its preferred candidates won only 44 percent of the time in 2008, when Barack Obama was first elected president.

In almost all forms of spending Â direct campaign contributions, independent expenditures and lobbying Â gun rights groups have far outspent gun control groups in recent decades, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. However, spending that advocates gun control has picked up in recent years, fueled by groups backed by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who was wounded in a 2011 shooting, and by Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York.

There have been hints in recent days, with the protests after the Parkland shooting and a string of businesses cutting ties with the N.R.A. Â as well as a fiery and defensive speech delivered by its leader at a conservative conference Â that the group is losing ground. Even some of its key political supporters, like Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, and top lawmakers in the state, have proposed measures like raising the age limit for gun purchases to 21.

John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group backed by Mr. Bloomberg, said he saw signs that the N.R.A.Âs influence was in decline, despite a surge in 2017 in federal lobbying spending by the organization. He pointed to its inability last year to get legislation through the Republican Congress that would give legal gun owners the right to carry concealed weapons outside their home states.

ÂWhat we are seeing right now is a reversal of fortune,Â Mr. Feinblatt said. ÂThe truth is, they are making bad bets. And they are out of sync. Their power is diminishing by the day.Â

THE NEWCOMERS Finding Refuge, Friendship, and Hope in an American Classroom By Helen Thorpe 396 pp. Scribner. $28.

Steve Bannon, we hear you. Too many white middle-class Americans, victimized by globalization, are struggling. Resources are scarce enough for people who were born right here.

Build the Wall! Build the Wall!

But maybe Americans are not as flinty a race as we appear to be when weÂre chanting at rallies. While President Trump was campaigning on the wall, Helen Thorpe spent a year inside a Ânewcomer classÂ for teenage refugees from Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Central America.

Her resulting book, ÂThe Newcomers,Â is a delicate and heartbreaking mystery story, as Thorpe slowly uncovers the secret catastrophes in the lives of young immigrants at South High School in Denver. They arrive mute, and they gradually gain the words and confidence to describe the journeys that led to the classroom.

ThorpeÂs parents emigrated from Ireland in 1965, when Thorpe was a year old, and she has written about young Mexican immigrants in America. A discerning chronicler of cultural misunderstanding, she started the book just as nativist resentment became a political movement.

South High School is DenverÂs designated school for non-English-speaking students whose educations have been disrupted. Here, teenagers uprooted by war, violence and deprivation meet the most generous of Americans. Nice people from churches, synagogues and Goodwill all appear in their lives, brought together by a generously funded public school system and a dedicated English Language Acquisition teacher, Eddie Williams.

A Mexican-American whose own mother hid her roots out of shame and fear, Williams presides over a miniature United Nations of survivors of conflicts across the planet. ThereÂs Hsar Htoo, born in a refugee camp in Thailand to a Karen family from Myanmar. For him, everything in Denver is new: Ârunning water, appliances, grocery stores, snow.Â

Williams worries about Iraqi sisters Jakleen and Mariam, daughters of a Christian father and Muslim mother; their father worked for the Americans, and then disappeared in Baghdad as sectarian violence erupted during the American troop drawdown. With their mother and a third sister, the girls spent six years in a Damascus suburb, missed a year of school because of car bombs and are now barely able to get to school on time.

Methusella and Solomon, teenage boys from the Democratic Republic of Congo, were driven out of Goma with their family. The brothers show up at South High School on time every day, Âalways nicely dressed,Â bending over their work with laser focus.

Thorpe gets to know some of the parents, like Methusella and SolomonÂs father, a dignified man wearing a collared shirt and navy trousers, working as a dishwasher and studying English out of a creased pocket dictionary he bought at Goodwill for a dollar. He speaks four languages including French, and when he sees dents in American houses, he must remind himself they are not caused by bullet holes, like the dents in houses back home.

Thorpe went deep, hiring 14 translators to conduct repeated interviews. Jakleen shares a letter she wrote to her father. Thorpe runs her hands over the Arabic letters on the page, and itÂs Âlike reading Braille inversely,Â because the girl pressed so hard with her pen. Still, some of their sad secrets stay buried. Hsar Htoo asks Thorpe before she interviews him not to ask him about his fatherÂs death. She also never really unravels how the unaccompanied Salvadoran children, fleeing one of the hemisphereÂs most violent nations, survived harrowing cross-border trips and made their way from federal detention facilities to Denver.

A year is a long time in teenage years, and frustration mounts. Some of the students are multilingual, and feel smarter than their lack of English allows. The Iraqi girls are so depressed they barely show up for school in the winter, racking up absences. The school encourages them with success stories. ThorpeÂs Arabic translator tells the girls that she raised her three children in America, and that they too hated it when they first arrived. Today, one is an engineer, another is a pediatric dentist, and the third is studying medicine.

Thorpe makes fascinating linguistic discoveries. At first, the newcomers canÂt even communicate with one another. As the weeks pass, they resort to Google Translate, sometimes bypassing English altogether. Watching them translate Swahili to Arabic and Portuguese, Thorpe notices cognates between Arabic and the African languages, remnants of ancient connections between two regions that to many Americans are as unfamiliar as the dark side of the moon.

ÂAs the kids discovered these commonalities, I began to feel as though I were watching something like the living embodiment of a linguistic tree,Â Thorpe writes. ÂThe classroom and the relationships forming inside of it were an almost perfect map of language proximity around the globe.Â

Thorpe has an epiphany of sorts when she learns that the word for ÂbookÂ is Âvirtually identicalÂ in the African languages and in Arabic. ÂThat was the moment when I first grasped my own arrogance as an English speaker,Â Thorpe writes. ÂI mean, the arrogance harbored by someone who knew only European languages, which rendered the well-laced interconnectedness of the rest of the world invisible.Â

In class, the teenagers are like teenagers everywhere. They are dramatic, they preen, they get depressed, they fall in love. One day, the students teach Thorpe a word Â qalb Â meaning ÂheartÂ in Farsi and Arabic. When Thorpe puts qalb into Google Translate, Arabic to English, something surprising happens. She is given a flood of meanings. ÂI got heart, center, middle, transformation, conscience, core, marrow, pith, pulp, gist, essence, quintessence, topple, alter, flip, tip, overturn, reversal, overthrow, capsize, whimsical, capricious, convert, change, counterfeit. Â My own concept of heart did not include flip, capsize or reverse.Â She concludes: ÂOur two cultures did not have the same idea of what was happening at the core of our beings. Â The idea of heart that these kids possessed appeared to have a lighter, more nimble quality.Â

But no matter how nimble and light their hearts might be, the students canÂt help noticing the rising resentment aimed their way. ÂXenophobia was not something that was listed formally as a factor that inhibited learning among E.L.A. students,Â she writes, Âbut as the weeks slipped by and the cacophony of the presidential election ratcheted up, elevating all kind of sentiments in the voting populace, including a virulent dislike of people from other countries, I came to think of the fear some people in my own country felt toward foreigners as an issue that itself inhibited the newcomersÂ learning. They were acutely sensitive and could detect when they were misunderstood.Â

Or hated.

Right after TrumpÂs election, the long commutes to and from school on DenverÂs public transit system become an obstacle course of shame and fear. People call the students ÂdirtyÂ and tell them to Âgo home.Â A passenger on a bus tells one girl, ÂWe are going to kick your ass out of this country.Â

The faculty at South High School struggles to help the students grapple with the new social climate, treating it like an emergency akin to a shooting or an outbreak of flu. The principal brings on nine temporary counselors to help, because the number of children seeking counseling Âreached levels that nobody had ever seen before.Â Two students had attempted suicide.

Nevertheless, ThorpeÂs book is a reminder that in an era of nativism, some Americans are still breaking down walls and nurturing newcomers, the seeds of the great American experiment.

The video, posted on the internet last summer, wasnÂt supposed to be the coming-out story of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

It opens with the voice of a man wryly narrating a fictional encounter in which he is asked to leave an airplane for Âspeaking Arabian.Â The words ÂQueer Muslim ProudÂ appear on the screen, followed by an introduction to the subject, in neon letters. As audience members in a dimly lit club cheer, Mr. Bhutto appears in a silky dress, dancing to the 1980s hit, ÂDisco Deewane,Â by the Pakistani singer Nazia Hassan. He shimmies and sways, a pink scarf pinned to his hair, light-blue eye shadow reaching up to his eyebrows.

South Asian viewers might not have recognized Mr. BhuttoÂs face but they certainly knew his name. In his native Pakistan, the news media voraciously covered the short film. The reaction focused, in a negative way, on him being a queer Muslim man.

ÂPerhaps I was a bit naÃ¯ve,Â Mr. Bhutto said in a phone interview. ÂI had been under the radar for so long, I didnÂt think people cared as much as they did.Â

Mr. Bhutto is a visual and performance artist who lives in San Francisco, and the video about him was created by filmmakers as part of ÂThe Turmeric Project,Â a series highlighting L.G.B.T.Q. South Asians living in America. Much of his work, including a recent show at the cityÂs SOMArts Cultural Center, explores the intersection of Islam, sexuality and masculinity.

But the reason viewers across the world clamored about the video, and why it continues to stir controversy, was because Mr. Bhutto is the grandson and namesake of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the founder of the Pakistan Peoples Party (P.P.P.), a left-wing political party that held power in Pakistan on and off since 1967. (The current governing party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, is a center-right conservative group.) After leading the country for much of the 1970s, the elder Zulfikar Bhutto was overthrown in a military coup and executed in 1979. Three of his children who went into politics, most prominently the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, later suffered similarly violent ends.

Mr. Bhutto was 6 years old when his father, Murtaza, was killed in a chaotic gunfight with the police outside the family home in Karachi; the exact circumstances of his death remain mysterious. Although Mr. Bhutto said that his immediate family has never pushed him to enter politics, he is considered by many Pakistanis to be the successor to the familyÂs turbulent dynasty. ÂBhutto Jr steps into art world, raises hopes,Â a headline in Dawn, one of PakistanÂs leading English-language newspapers, said. In a Facebook comment, one user pleaded to Bhutto, ÂYou are doing nice job but please take lead party of your grand papa we all missing you.Â

Equally impassioned but hostile reactions from overseas South Asians to the video centered on Mr. BhuttoÂs sexuality, especially on the 10-second-long scene capturing his joyful drag performance. In Pakistan, same-sex sexual acts are prohibited by law, and there are no anti-discrimination laws to protect L.G.B.T.Q. citizens, although the Senate recently approved amendments to a bill that allows trans people to choose their gender without needing to appear before a medical board.

News reports of ostracism, legal threats and attacks against gay Pakistanis, or against those perceived to be gay, are not uncommon; in one highly publicized case, a transgender activist died from gunshot wounds after delays in her medical care. Homophobic comments on Mr. BhuttoÂs video, both from media sources and social media users, employed derogatory terms and curses to condemn him and his art. ÂThere was so much negativity when it came out, and the focus was on the drag part of it,Â Mr. Bhutto said.

Drag is not openly accepted in Pakistan. The closest thing may be the performances by hijras Â transgender or intersex people who were categorized as males at birth but who do not conform to traditional ideas of masculinity. While they do not fit the Western definition of drag queens, they dance and sing at public ceremonies while wearing womenÂs clothing. At first, Mr. Bhutto was reluctant to discuss his own use of cross-dressing. ÂBut now the catÂs out of the bag,Â he said. ÂDrag is an integral part of my practice; what point is there being shy and tiptoeing around it anymore?Â

Mr. Bhutto, 27, began using visual and performance works to explore Islamic identity after coming to the United States, in 2014, to pursue his M.F.A. at the San Francisco Art Institute. Newly arrived in the city, he was shocked by a notorious series of anti-Muslim ads on city buses, paid for by Pamela Geller and the American Freedom Defense Initiative. ÂIt made me want to hide who I was,Â he said; at the same time, he added, the explicit Islamophobia Âenergized me in a way I wasnÂt in Pakistan.Â Alongside the Iranian artist Minoosh Zomorodinia, he began exploring acts that emphasized and embraced his status as a Muslim in America: together, the two developed Âprayformances,Â in which they completed the Muslim ritual of praying in public spaces.

It was another act of hatred that spurred Mr. Bhutto to also weave his identity as a gay person into his art. On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen, an American Muslim man, killed 49 people at a popular Orlando gay club. The tragedy, and unsubstantiated rumors that Mr. Mateen may have been a closeted gay man, opened up a rare mainstream discourse, both in United States and in the Muslim world, on queerness in Islam. It became clear to Mr. Bhutto that Âpeople think youÂre either queer or youÂre Muslim, and that somehow those two things are in opposition to one another.Â

During that period, Mr. Bhutto attended his first drag show. ÂIf you arenÂt used to it, itÂs very impactful: the makeup, the costume, the performance, the songs,Â he said. He first tried his hand at drag a few months later, at a local bar. Over time, he began building his performances around music and spoken-word sections that address his religion and cultural background Â Âwhich can be surprisingly jarring and political to the audience,Â he said.

In the same vein, his mixed-media series ÂMussalmaan MusclemenÂ aims for Âinteresting confusion for the viewer,Â this time through the layering of cheap fabrics from Pakistan over beefcake photos from an Urdu translation of an exercise manual supposedly originally written by Arnold Schwarzenegger.

ÂThere are some misguided ideas about what Islam represents and the threat that Muslim men pose,Â Mr. Bhutto explained. By combining homoerotic images of musclebound men with embroidered sections of flowery cloth, and by emphasizing the calligraphic Arabic script, he seeks to challenge assumptions about Muslim masculinity.

Last fall, ÂMussalmaan MusclemenÂ was included in the Karachi Biennale. Though it was the first time that Mr. Bhutto had been home since the ÂTurmeric ProjectÂ video caused an uproar, he said that he wasnÂt nervous Â he has always made sure to maintain a low profile when he travels to Pakistan. But it would be more difficult to stay incognito if he were openly practicing his art there, which, he said, is why heÂs not interested in moving back to the country.

ÂI respect what my father did,Â Mr. Bhutto said. ÂHe dedicated his entire life to a cause, he made himself physically vulnerable for a cause, I respect that Â but, honestly, itÂs not for me.Â

In San Francisco, Mr. Bhutto is busy with his show at SOMArts, ÂThe Third Muslim: Queer and Trans Muslim Narratives of Resistance and Resilience,Â which he organized with the artist Yas Ahmed. With hundreds of people in attendance at the opening ceremony, the show has been well-received in the art world Â and no backlash in Pakistan. It also features work by 15 queer, trans and gender nonconforming Muslim artists from around the world, including Syria, Iran, and Pakistan.

The exhibition Âtackles the representation of Islam and Muslims all over the world but through a queer lens,Â Mr. Bhutto said. At least in America, he noted, Âthese days, identifying as Muslim is more tricky than identifying as queer, funnily enough.Â

GUADALAJARA, Mexico Â In a cafe in downtown Guadalajara, Pedro Kumamoto, 28, an independent politician running for a Senate seat, was savoring his early morning coffee when a middle-aged man approached.

ÂI am sorry to interrupt Â I just wanted to greet you,Â the older man said, his eyes starting to tear up. ÂI am sorry for getting emotional, but you are a true inspiration.Â

Such effusive displays of appreciation for politicians are unusual in Mexico, but encounters like this have become common for Mr. Kumamoto, an indication of how hungry Mexicans have become for alternative leaders amid growing disenchantment with the traditional political parties.

Two years ago, Mr. Kumamoto was elected as the first independent legislator in the state Congress of Jalisco, a feat possible only after a 2014 change to the federal Constitution allowed for candidates not affiliated with parties. Now, Mr. Kumamoto, a self-described Âsocial democrat,Â is leading in the polls for a seat in the federal Senate.

He is among dozens of independent candidates running for state or federal office in the July 1 general election who are looking to deliver a sharp rebuke to politics as usual in Mexico.

Among Mexican voters, there is Âa great dissatisfaction with the traditional partisan system and the statesÂ lack of ability to respond to citizensÂ demands,Â said Alejandro PoirÃ©, secretary of the interior in the administration of President Felipe CalderÃ³n, whose term ended in 2012. ÂA growing number of citizens,Â he added, are Âtrying to partake in this system through alternative channels.Â

For instance, 16 members of WikipolÃ­tica, a leftist youth movement founded in 2013, have qualified to run as independent candidates for federal and state races. Many are under 30, and they include Mr. Kumamoto.

ÂWe share a common principle, and that is if you donÂt get yourself involved in politics, someone else will come and do it for you,Â Mr. Kumamoto said, describing the goals of WikipolÃ­tica, whose name, a play on Wikipedia, is meant to suggest grass-roots politics.

The political establishment, as embodied by the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which held power uninterrupted from 1929 to 2000, is perceived by many Mexicans as inclined to corruption and graft.

ÂTo be born and grow up in a country ruled by the PRI meant you thought that there was one way of doing politics,Â said Roberto Castillo, 27, a founding member of WikipolÃ­tica, who is now running for a seat in Mexico CityÂs state-level Congress. ÂThis meant patronage politics over merit, knowledge or leadership, and we were made to believe that was morally acceptable,Â he said. ÂBut that is changing.Â

Carlos Brito is another youth activist looking to enter and change the political system.

An earthquake in September left thousands of people homeless in his small hometown, Jojutla, in the south-central state of Morelos, and local leaders were accused of hoarding aid for the victims. Mr. Brito, 30, said he could not bear the outrage, so he decided to run for mayor, leaving a successful digital start-up in Mexico City and moving back to Jojutla.

Both Mr. Kumamoto and Mr. Brito said one of the biggest challenges facing independent candidates is overcoming voter skepticism that the political status quo can be challenged.

ÂWe have been convinced by this lunatic idea that nothing will ever change,Â Mr. Kumamoto said. ÂThat is what I call the anticipated defeat, and we must realize that is simply not true.Â

Mr. Brito is a former member of a student movement that emerged in 2012 to protest media manipulation during the campaign of President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, who took office in December of that year.

Reflecting on the PeÃ±a Nieto administration, which has been tainted by corruption scandals, spiraling violence and human rights violations, Mr. Brito said the most valuable lesson for young activists is Âto train yourself against frustration.Â

Mr. Brito expressed confidence that the surge of independent candidates would begin to have an effect. ÂWe are witnessing the demise of the political establishment,Â he said. ÂAnd we should be happy about that.Â

But in a political system that favors established parties Â Mexican law, for example, guarantees parties funding and media access during campaigns Â the electoral performance of most of the independents in the coming election is expected to be marginal, experts say.

ÂThere is a political oligopoly designed with high entry barriers and enforced by restrictive laws that prevent us from having more Kumamotos,Â Mr. PoirÃ© said.

While many of the independents may struggle to win their elections, Mr. Kumamoto has established himself as a rising force, at least in Jalisco.

The great-grandson of Japanese immigrants, Mr. Kumamoto said his activism began when he joined a sit-in at age 19 to halt the removal of hundreds of trees for a highway overpass. He later became president of the student council at his college.

Now Kuma, as he is known among his peers, enjoys a kind of celebrity in Guadalajara. People of all ages stop him in the streets for selfies, and passing cars honk and drivers raise their fists in support.

At his campaign headquarters in Guadalajara, a group of young people were organizing crowdfunding efforts, rallies and media campaigns.

Sitting among them was Susana Ochoa, 27, an activist who served as the communications manager in KumamotoÂs campaign two years ago. With a passion for politics and feminism, Ms. Ochoa said she felt it was time to step on the stage herself and run for a seat in JaliscoÂs Congress.

ÂI decided to do it to redefine what it means to be a woman and a woman in politics in Mexico, and so that girls of future generations find it easier to raise their hand, not only in politics, but in every aspect of their lives,Â Ms. Ochoa said.

She said she viewed the rise in independent candidacies not as a ÂpanaceaÂ for all that ails Mexico, but rather as a Âtool to open cracks with.Â

As a lawmaker, Mr. Kumamoto sees one crack to open: He says he wants to show that politics can mean something other than corruption and theft, and heÂs donated 70 percent of his salary to a fund focused on political participation.

Landing in the state Congress at age 25, he knew it was important to show he could be effective, despite his inexperience.

He garnered multiparty support to pass legislation in which political parties gave up much of their public funding. Called ÂNo Money Without Votes,Â the state law cuts funds assigned to the parties by more than half, and calculates future funding based on the votes each party wins in the previous election.

He won passage of another initiative to end protection from prosecution for JaliscoÂs elected officials. Early criticism of his lack of experience and political naÃ¯vetÃ© was quickly silenced.

But opponents argue his popularity is overblown and fueled by a media frenzy over his age, independent status and campaign, which broke with the norm of patronage politics.

ÂHis legislative triumphs speak more about the favorable circumstances of the political climate here than of his true leadership,Â said MÃ³nica Almeida LÃ³pez, a state representative from the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, who opposed the ÂNo Money Without VotesÂ initiative, claiming it would damage smaller parties.

Among his political inspirations, Mr. Kumamoto said, are the leftist former president of Uruguay, JosÃ© Mujica, and movements like Occupy Wall Street. Now, he has begun to inspire others.

At a small rally in the center of Guadalajara, a banner read: ÂWe will replace them.Â Nine young candidates running for the Jalisco Congress had collected the signatures they needed to run and were celebrating.

Among them was Alejandra Vargas, 29, a political novice with a degree in industrial engineering, who said she was flabbergasted when Mr. Kumamoto suggested she run.

ÂI didnÂt even know what a congressional representative did,Â Mrs. Vargas said. ÂBut when I thought about it, I told myself I had no excuses for turning it down as I had always preached about civic participation being the backbone of democracy.Â

Mr. Kumamoto stood in the back of the crowd that was cheering the new independent candidates. ÂThis is what it is all about, to pass along the baton,Â he said.

A gray-haired man walking by stopped at the sight of the rally.

ÂHe is not a politician, he is one of us,Â said Jorge GonzÃ¡lez, 63, referring to Mr. Kumamoto. ÂHe is a normal person and that is what makes him so great.

Mr. GonzÃ¡lez noted that a typical Mexican politician does not ride a bike or wear tennis shoes, as Mr. Kumamoto is known to do.

ÂI just trust him, he said. ÂHe has my vote.Â

Last month, Alabama conducted a novel political experiment, conscripting the stateÂs Republican voters as its lab rats. The question that was officially on the ballot was whom the party should nominate for the United States Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in February. One option was Luther Strange, a former state attorney general, who had filled the seat since being appointed by a Republican governor who happened to be under investigation by StrangeÂs own office. The other was Roy Moore, a twice-defrocked State Supreme Court justice described last month by the conservative National Review as Ânothing more than a bigoted, theocratic and ignorant buffoon,Â who has argued variously that Muslims shouldnÂt be allowed in Congress, that homosexuality should be illegal, that multiple Midwestern communities are currently governed by Shariah law and that the Sept. 11 attacks might have been divine punishment for AmericaÂs sins.

Political caricatures donÂt come much broader than these. Strange was the establishment incarnate; Moore was the Republican electorateÂs id made ruddy flesh, an avatar of the latent nativism and conspiracism that Donald TrumpÂs detractors inside and outside the Republican Party blamed for his rise. The only wrinkle was that the president endorsed not Moore but Strange Â and the race, as Katie Glueck of McClatchy newspapers wrote shortly before the election, became Âthe biggest disagreement to date between Trump and the most committed elements of his base.Â The outcome would be an indicator of whether Trump had really captured the Republican electorate or whether the forces that carried him to office were beyond his, or anyoneÂs, control.

In the end, Moore trounced Strange by nine points. National Review offered hopefully that at least the election contradicted claims that Trump had turned the party into a cult of personality; the contributor Fred Bauer wrote that the result Âcould be a sign that the Republican base will not be willing to roll over for the president on any and every issue.Â Other observers were less delicate. ÂThe Republican base is so nuts,Â the Washington Post editorial writer Stephen Stromberg concluded, that even when Trump advised otherwise, Âthey had to pick one of the most divisive figures in American politics to represent them.Â Jamelle Bouie of Slate argued that MooreÂs win was evidence of how, Âsince 2008, many of those voters who comprise the Republican base have grown increasingly untethered from mainstream politics.Â This was a ÂJurassic ParkÂ vision of the Republican base, in which party leaders, after fecklessly creating and nurturing a monster, find themselves powerless to stop it once the electric fences go out on the island.

A political partyÂs base, for much of the 20th century, usually came with an indefinite article attached: a base, rather than the base. This was a straightforward reflection of how parties operated, as sometimes lumpy and uneasy coalitions of disparate interests. In 1975, when Ronald Reagan was plotting his second run for president, it was a bipartisan assumption that the Republican PartyÂs existing bases Â an ad hoc assemblage of WASPs, rural Midwesterners and a growing but still insufficient segment of middle-class suburbia Â were too narrow and unstable for the G.O.P. to escape minority-party status.

ÂHow do you feel about calls to broaden the Republican Party?Â a Newsweek reporter asked Reagan that March. ÂI am an example of base-broadening,Â Reagan replied, Âhaving been a New Deal Democrat most of my life.Â Reagan was implicitly speaking not of a Republican base but of the Republican base: a singular constituency that needed to grow and could Â especially into the white suburban electorate.

ReaganÂs 1980 campaign won seven percent more of the labor-union vote than Gerald Ford did in 1976, but he won just 10 percent of the nonwhite vote, significantly less than Ford. Many of the major contenders for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination ran explicitly on the idea of bringing nonwhite constituencies into the party Â none more enthusiastically than Representative Jack Kemp of New York.

ÂBlacks did not vote Republican because no one ever appealed to them before,Â he told the journalist Juan Williams in 1987. The same, he said, went for Hispanics. ÂIÂm staking my whole case on my ability to broaden the base of the Republican Party, not doing it at the expense of principles but building a coalition for democratic capitalism, people capitalism.Â Kemp believed that his vision of racial outreach could bring the party control of Washington. Republicans had been a minority in the House for decades, he said. ÂHow long do we have to be chained to some nihilistic faction?Â

Kemp lost to George Bush Â himself a self-identified base-broadener, but one whose candidacy was marred by the race-baiting ÂWillie HortonÂ ad that an outside political-action committee aired against his Democratic rival, Michael Dukakis. Lee Atwater, BushÂs campaign manager, vowed Â and later apologized for vowing Â that Âby the time weÂre finished, theyÂre going to wonder whether Willie Horton is DukakisÂs running mate.Â It was a testament to the partyÂs cynicism, naÃ¯vetÃ© or both that Atwater, in taking the helm of the Republican National Committee after BushÂs victory, was tasked with improving outreach to black and Hispanic voters.

In 1990, when Bush proposed a tax-reform package that included modest increases in some brackets, House Republicans revolted, led by an ambitious Georgia congressman named Newt Gingrich. ÂIt is a signal,Â he told The Washington Post, Âthat the base of the Republican Party opposes raising taxes and that the package had better be awfully good.Â The base had, in GingrichÂs formulation, become something new: not a coalition to be expanded but a force to be propitiated or crossed at BushÂs peril. It was not there to be molded by politicians like Jack Kemp. It was there to give orders to them, through mediums like Gingrich Â whose personal policy hobbyhorses, it just so happened, matched the baseÂs.

Shamanistic base-whisperers like Gingrich proliferated on the right in the 1990s, both inside and outside the party and particularly among conservative evangelical leaders. When Bob Dole Â who had campaigned for the 1988 nomination on, as his spokeswoman put it, the Âneed to broaden the base of the Republican PartyÂ Â said he had no Âlitmus testÂ for the abortion views of his running mate in 1996, he drew harsh words from James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family: ÂWhy does this man insist on alienating the conservative base of the Republican Party?Â Ralph Reed, the executive director of the Christian Coalition, advised that Dole Âdesperately needed to find some social and moral issues that he could grab hold of and use to mobilize the base.Â This base harks back to the bases of the pre-Reagan era: It is a constituency with clearly delineated borders and concrete demands. But it does have one crucial resemblance to the aspirational base of ReaganÂs or KempÂs imagination: its singularity. It implies that the Republican Party is not a coalition of interests but the tribune of an essentially unified tribe. And when the tribe stages a revolt, as the Tea Party did a decade later, the leaders have no choice but to follow.

Conservatives often point out, correctly, that todayÂs Democratic base is, if anything, more monolithic in its policy views than its Republican counterpart, with more uniform positions on issues like abortion, immigration and taxes. This August, when the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said the committee would not impose an abortion litmus test on its 2018 candidates, the pushback was fierce. Ilyse Hogue, the president of Naral Pro-Choice America, said, ÂAmong the rank-and-file groups that make up the majority of the Democratic base, there is really no split on abortion rights.Â

But for all that, the Democratic base remains disparate in one essential respect: the demographics of the people who make it up. Meanwhile, in the years since KempÂs cri de coeur, Republican identification among African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians has barely budged Â but the countryÂs geographical and demographic trends, along with artful redistricting and the Electoral College, have rendered this inconsequential to the partyÂs political hegemony.

This explains, in part, the asymmetry of the two partiesÂ chaotic 2016 primaries. Democratic voters fell out viciously over two candidates who did not differ appreciably on most policy areas but conveyed starkly different ideas of the party. Republican voters, meanwhile, passed over candidates with actual fiscal-conservative and evangelical bona fides, like Ted Cruz, in favor of one whose only sustained and consistent point of contact with past Republican practice was the winking subtext of the partyÂs white identity politics, delivered without the wink. One partyÂs base knew what it believed; the otherÂs knew who it was.

If not even Trump can fully bend the Republican base to his will at this point, it is because doing so would buck decadesÂ worth of inertia. In May last year, as TrumpÂs path to victory in the Republican primaries was becoming clear, Matthew Continetti, the editor in chief of The Washington Free Beacon, observed: ÂThe Republican base is the party of Trump. ItÂs not the G.O.P. that weÂve come to know.Â But of course, as Roy Moore could tell you, it is both.
