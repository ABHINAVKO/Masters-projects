Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

•  President Trump’s remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, have been conciliatory. He even broached the possibility, however remote, that he would re-enter a Pacific trade agreement, which he scrapped last year.

Calling reports of a rift with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain “a false rumor,” Mr. Trump suggested he might still visit London.

Mrs. May’s speech, and its reception, underlined Britain’s diminished stature on the world stage.

Also at Davos, many officials and executives told us they were looking to China as a world leader in fighting climate change — even as the country’s carbon emissions appeared to again be rising. Here’s our full coverage of the forum.

• The White House is offering Democrats a deal on immigration: In exchange for eventual citizenship for so-called Dreamers — immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors — Democrats would have to accept a border wall and stricter immigration policies.

Most Americans want legal status for Dreamers. We talked to some who don’t.

Separately, our correspondents in Washington learned that President Trump ordered the firing of Robert Mueller, the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation, in June. Mr. Trump backed off after a top lawyer threatened to quit.

_____

• The two-day runoff in the Czech Republic’s presidential elections begins today.

The outcome of the vote will help decide whether the country continues to be drawn toward Russia and China under Milos Zeman, the incumbent, or more fully returns to the embrace of the European Union under his challenger, Jiri Drahos. Polls suggest a narrow race.

Victory is virtually assured, however, for Vladimir Putin during Russia’s presidential election in March. With no real opposition, Mr. Putin’s greatest threat is voter indifference, our Moscow correspondent writes.

_____

• The arrival of voice-controlled assistants in cars has raised new concerns about security and privacy. Hacks could include annoying pranks like a honking horn, or more serious breaches such as remotely unlocking a home’s doors for a robbery.

In other car news, our correspondent in Frankfurt illustrates how far German carmakers went to skew research on the damaging effects of diesel emissions.

The automakers financed an experiment in which 10 monkeys squatted in airtight chambers, watching cartoons for entertainment as they inhaled fumes from a rigged diesel Volkswagen Beetle.

• Some types of song are universally recognizable by people across all cultures, a new study by scientists at Harvard suggests. But can you tell a lullaby from a love song? Take a quiz based on the study and find out.

(Above, Aborigines of northern Australia performed a corroboree dance for visitors in 1978. Music for the corroboree was part of the study.)

Another new study suggests that we are not only shaped by the genes that we inherit, but also by those we don’t. (It compared thousands of Icelanders to their parents.)

And the discovery of a fossilized jawbone in a cave in Israel could rewrite the story of human migration, proving that Homo sapiens ventured out of Africa about 50,000 years earlier than previously thought.

• In Davos, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expressed surprise over the market turmoil he unleashed with an apparently offhand comment about the U.S. dollar. The currency plunged to a three-year low.

• Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank’s president, is trying to make the onetime powerhouse of global finance relevant again. But his embrace of Wall Street is controversial.

• The U.S. is the only industrialized country not to mandate paid parental leave, but more American companies are beginning to offer benefits in order to retain talent.

• Huawei’s flagship smartphone is impressive, but users have to decide for themselves whether they trust the Chinese manufacturer.

•  Here’s a snapshot of global markets.

• Our Beirut Bureau tried to help unpack the developments in northern Syria, where Turkey, a U.S. ally, is attacking Kurdish militias backed by Washington. [The New York Times]

• Germany suspended plans to upgrade Turkish tanks as Turkey’s offensive in Syria progresses. [Reuters]

• In Italy, commuters took to social media to denounce a government-owned rail company after a train derailed near Milan, leaving three people dead and dozens injured. [The New York Times]

• The Dutch government is said to have warned American officials about efforts by Russian hackers to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. [Volkskrant]

• Officials in Ivory Coast said that they had broken up an international ivory-smuggling network, the second such bust in Africa this month. [The New York Times]

• In an unusual email exchange, a museum curator rebuffed a request for a Vincent van Gogh painting to be hung in President Trump’s private living quarters. She offered a solid gold toilet instead. [The New York Times]

Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.

• Recipe of the day: Spend some time this weekend cooking an excellent risotto with sausage and parsley.

• What happens inside our bodies when we exercise?

• To combat “text neck,” put your phone down and keep your head up.

• Scandinavia is known for its innovative craft brews, but in Stockholm, the trend is less is more: new bars and bottle shops that exclusively stock low-alcohol beers.

• A museum in the Netherlands has taken all the art off the walls and instead will present music and sounds. (One of the works is a musical séance, which conjures memories of Amy Winehouse.)

• Researchers in Germany have created a tiny robot that one day may be used to deliver drugs inside the human body.

• A writer reflects on the work of Ursula K. Le Guin: “She reserved the right to think, and write, and react as she saw fit.”

• Finally, a reminder to cherish our time on this planet: The Doomsday Clock, a symbol of concerns about humanity’s annihilation, was advanced the closest to midnight since the 1950s.

She wanted to fly, but no U.S. aviation school would admit her. So she taught herself French, moved to France and became the first African-American woman to earn a pilot’s license, in 1921.

Bessie Coleman was born on this day in 1892 in Atlanta, Tex. The daughter of sharecroppers, who were also of Native American descent, she was inspired by stories of the Wright brothers and World War I pilots.

Ms. Coleman’s brother told her of seeing Frenchwomen fly when he served in World War I, so she headed across the Atlantic. She earned her international pilot’s license in seven months.

She returned to the U.S. and performed as a stunt pilot, dazzling audiences at air shows — but only those that were open to viewers of her race. “The air is the only place free from prejudice,” she said.

On April 30, 1926, Ms. Coleman was airborne when her biplane flipped over during a test flight. She plummeted to her death from the open cockpit. She was 34.

“Before she died, however, Miss Coleman became a role model for many young black women and, as a consequence, flying became popular among them,” The Times noted in 1985.

The mighty Goldman business of trading bonds, derivatives, currencies and commodities has disappointed in recent years. Several years of calm in those markets caused a steep drop off in trading revenue.

That is why Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman’s chief executive, speaking at an investor conference on Tuesday, seemed to embrace the recent market volatility – and see it as an opportunity to invest more in its underperforming trading operations. Noting the strength of the global economy and the big recent movements in oil prices and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, Mr. Blankfein said:

“In this context, I don’t think it would be a good strategic move to forgo the upside in the business from here. In fact, we recently deployed more capital as we see a more attractive opportunity set.”

Wall Street watchers should ask:

Is this good or bad volatility? In recent years, investment bank executives had differentiated between two types of volatility: One that leads to less trading because it frightens and confuses investors, and another that generates a higher level of trading because investors see changes in yields and prices they have to adapt to. Goldman is counting on the latter.

Is Goldman well positioned to profit? The bank has a plan to revamp its bond trading operations that centers on broadening the types of investors it does business with. The bank was too dependent on hedge funds that liked to make big bets on bonds, currencies and commodities, so it has made efforts to bring in large asset managers and other financial institutions as clients. But do these new clients trade anywhere near as much as the hedge funds, and are the trades they do as profitable as the ones the hedge funds favor?

Goldman’s first-quarter earnings could offer clues.

Blue Apron gained notoriety when its I.P.O. proved to be one of the biggest busts last year and spurred talk that the meal kit industry was a flash in the pan. But its latest results showed some tentative signs of life — and those of its biggest rival, HelloFresh of Germany, suggest that it isn’t worth writing off the sector just yet.

What Blue Apron reported

• For the fourth quarter, the company reported a 13 percent year-on-year drop in revenue, to $187.7 million — less than analysts had expected.

• It also reported a $39 million loss for the quarter, again a smaller loss than expected.

• Both the cost of goods sold and marketing expenditures were down from the year-ago period.

• The company’s customer rolls dropped 15 percent year-on-year to 746,000, though the company said that was to be expected from the lower marketing spend.

• The average orders per customer and revenue per customer each rose a tiny bit.

Blue Apron’s ability to hold the line on marketing expenses was probably the most promising sign, though that was in part because management was also focused on improving operations at the company’s distribution center in Linden, N.J.

The HelloFresh perspective

HelloFresh has had a better run in the stock markets since going public last year. The latest good news for the company: Its preliminary sales numbers for its just-closed fiscal quarter beat analyst expectations, while its customer base has grown.

Here’s what its C.E.O., Dominik Richter, told me last week about why the meal-kit business isn’t doomed, necessarily:

• His company has managed to make its marketing profitable, with every dollar spent turning into $3 in sales.

• Though the company overall has run a loss — 93 million euro, or $115 million, in the 2016 fiscal year — it has shown profitability in some of its markets. Mr. Richter contended that the company could become profitable this year. “It’s not something that we need to strive for or put a lot of effort into,” he said.

• He added that he doesn’t see supermarkets selling their own meal kits as true competitors, running counter to investor fears that the combined Amazon/Whole Foods portends doom for smaller competitors. “We have more in common with Chipotle or a fast-casual chain,” he said.

The tale of the tape

Blue Apron’s shares are down 66 percent since their debut. HelloFresh’s are up 23 percent since they started trading.

The head of Blackstone’s real estate business has long been considered the likely successor to Hamilton “Tony” James, the firm’s president and chief operating officer.

Today that became a reality.

Blackstone announced that Mr. Gray will become the private-equity firm’s president and C.O.O., taking over the day-to-day operations of the firm. Mr. James was named executive vice chairman. Both will report to Stephen A. Schwarzman, Blackstone’s co-founder, chairman and chief executive.

Mr. Gray, 48, joined Blackstone straight out of college in 1992. He has led Blackstone’s real estate group since its creation in 2005.

Mr. James, 67, joined Blackstone in 2002 as vice chairman and C.O.O. He was named president in 2006.

“I have had a wonderful 15 years at Blackstone so far and still savor every minute of it. One of my most important responsibilities is succession, and I am blessed to have a spectacular leader and investor like Jon Gray to whom I can hand the reins,” Mr. James said.

The Federal Reserve chairman took his position this year facing plenty of economic factors that could stoke inflation, including:

• Resurgent global economies

• Years of cheap and plentiful credit

• Joblessness falling to multiyear lows, making it easier for workers to get a raise or a bonus, which could push up companies’ costs

Then the Fed’s job got harder. Congress passed a large tax cut that will add a jolt of stimulus to an economy that no longer needs extra juice. The stock market loved it and kept zooming higher.

But turbulence hit. On Feb. 5, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted over 1,100 points, or 4.6 percent.

That brought some much-needed caution

• Junk bonds, for instance, have sold off. (Financial conditions, however, are still loose enough for Broadcom to raise $100 billion in the debt markets for its Qualcomm takeover bid.)

• Investors in the stock market, down 7.6 percent from its high, now know the party can’t go on uninterrupted.

• People are having a real debate about inflation.

In other words, nose-diving stocks did Mr. Powell a favor: They threw some cold water on the animal spirits that Congress whipped up.

The notes of caution

The best scenario for the Fed is that the rate hikes forecast for this year are enough to also limit the stimulus from the tax overhaul.

Meanwhile, to finance the deficit, the Treasury Department now has to sell more billions of dollars of extra bonds. The huge new government demand for credit could push up interest rates in the markets. The Fed may be fine with that, given that it is expected to raise interest rates this year. But if interest rates in the bond market spike higher than investors expect, or the Fed is happy with, Mr. Powell would face his first big challenge as Fed chairman.

— Peter Eavis

And for the Fed’s No. 2 spot..: The WSJ is reporting that the Trump administration is considering nominating Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester as vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington.

In brief prepared remarks at a ceremonial swearing-in on Tuesday, Mr. Powell said: “While the challenges we face are always evolving, the Fed’s approach will remain the same. Today, the global economy is recovering strongly for the first time in a decade. We are in the process of gradually normalizing both interest rate policy and our balance sheet with a view to extending the recovery and sustaining the pursuit of our objectives.”

Is the 30-year bull market in bonds over? Ray Dalio thinks so. The Bridgewater Associates mogul wrote on LinkedIn, “We don’t know exactly how far we are from the top in the stock market and then the economy, though it is clear that we are past the top in the bond market.” (Others disagree.)

More in markets: They jumped yesterday, but how will they react to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation report tomorrow? And who is “50 Cent,” the trader who made $200 million from last week’s volatility?

In its prime, Chipotle Mexican Grill positioned itself as the paragon of clean, casual, cool dining, a darling of Wall Street, a restaurant industry innovator.

Basically, nothing like Taco Bell.

How the tables have turned. Chipotle has spent the past few years struggling to recover from a string of food safety crises, steady abandonment by its clientele and a plunging stock price. For help, the chain is turning to the quick-serve cousin many once thought was inferior.

Brian Niccol, the chief executive of Taco Bell, will replace Chipotle’s founder Steve Ells as chief executive on March 5. Mr. Niccol is tasked with replicating his success transforming Taco Bell from a fast food afterthought to a social media-savvy company with sleek new stores and a hugely popular Doritos Locos Tacos product.

Shares of Chipotle are up 12 percent after hours.

Broadcom announced on Tuesday that it is seeking only a majority of the chip maker’s board seats in next month’s shareholder vote.

Broadcom said that it was now pursuing the election of six nominees that it had put forward, rather than the full 11 it had originally named.

Mr. Tan essentially signaled that Broadcom would seek fewer board seats in an interview on CNBC on Monday.

“If at least a majority of our slate does not get in on March 6, then I guess we will get the message that this deal is not going to happen,” he said. We will walk.”

Both companies are expected to meet on Wednesday for the first time in months.

After nearly four years on Mondelez International’s board, the activist investor Nelson Peltz is stepping down on March 1 to focus on his other board commitments.

The decision comes two months after Mr. Peltz won a seat on Procter & Gamble’s board in what was one of the largest, priciest and nastiest corporate proxy fights in history. He will join P.&G.’s board on March 1.

Mondelez said that Debra Crew, the Reynolds American chief executive, and Peter May, Trian Fund president, will be named to the board the same day as Mr. Peltz steps down.

Mr. Peltz joined Mondelez’s board in 2014 after he ended his push for a merger between Pepsi and Mondelez.

As the billionaire prepares to get back in the hedge fund game with Point72 Asset Management, a lawsuit from a female executive, Lauren Bonner, has drawn back the curtain on what she describes as a toxic environment for women:

• Just one of 125 portfolio managers is a woman.

• Women were often excluded from meetings.

• For several weeks last year, a white board in one executive’s office had “pussy” written on it.

Mr. Cohen himself isn’t accused of wrongdoing, and Point72 denied the allegations.

The bigger picture: Point72 is expected to open as a full-fledged hedge fund this year, after Mr. Cohen’s ban from the securities industry expired in 2017. And Ms. Bonner’s lawsuit is an unusually prominent sexual discrimination case in the world of hedge funds.

Among the assets that could be sold to private financiers if the White House got its $1.5 trillion infrastructure investment program:

• Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Dulles International Airport

• The George Washington and Baltimore Washington parkways

• The Washington Aqueduct

The thinking behind the plan

The administration believes private investors can do a better job of running highways, airports and railroads than the government, and states and local governments can do a better job of allocating money. But critics say its plan unfairly favors rural areas over liberal-leaning major cities. (Economists also say that it’s a “bizarre time” for such a stimulus, Ben White of Politico writes.)

An interesting point about infrastructure investment

Dan Primack of Axios points out:

The average level of return sought by infrastructure investment funds was about 10.6 percent in 2016, down from 14 percent in 2004, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Global Infrastructure Investor Association. They’re generally considered a low-but-steady return asset class, which may be why they only raised about $200 billion from 2006 to 2016.

The big question: Can private investors fill in the $1.3 trillion required to fulfill the White House’s vision?

• The White House’s $4.4 trillion budget (which lawmakers will likely ignore) would add $7 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. The Trump administration’s budget chief, Mick Mulvaney, conceded, “Does it balance? No, it doesn’t.”

• The administration is suffering from a 34 percent turnover rate, the highest for a White House in decades. (NYT)

• The controversy over Rob Porter again raised the issue of national security clearances at the White House — and why Jared Kushner’s still isn’t permanent. (NYT)

• “Reciprocal taxes” on countries the White House considers unfair trade partners won’t be simple to enact. (NYT)

• On immigration, the Senate is taking an unusual approach: an open-ended debate to build a bill from scratch on the legislative floor. (NYT)

• Republicans are pressuring Bob Corker to consider staying on, for fear of losing his Senate seat. (Politico)

When Mark Zuckerberg said it was “pretty crazy” to think fake news on Facebook could tip an election, one executive feared that the company would head down the “pariah path that Uber was on.” Now, people say that he has faced a deeper realization about that ways that the platform can be abused.

Here’s a recounting of what Mr. Zuckerberg told employees last Thanksgiving about the company’s responsibility, from Nicholas Thompson and Fred Vogelstein of Wired:

More Facebook news: It’s losing younger users, eMarketer says. Its default privacy settings violate German law, a Berlin court says. And it’s experimenting with a news section on its video platform to help users find reliable sources.

Broadcom’s C.E.O., Hock Tan, told CNBC what would stop him, as the companies prepare for a Valentine’s Day meeting:

• If Qualcomm’s shareholders don’t vote for a majority of the directors that Broadcom has nominated for its target’s board. “I guess we will get the message that this deal is not going to happen,” he said.

• If Qualcomm raises its bid for NXP Semiconductors beyond $110 a share. “We have made it very clear, it’s a clear transfer of value from Qualcomm shareholders to NXPI shareholders,” he said.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• The U.S. government shutdown is over: President Trump signed a bill funding the government through Feb. 8, giving lawmakers more time for immigration talks.

In return for the Democrats’ support, Republican leaders promised to address the fate of young, undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.

Here’s how each senator voted and a look at the bipartisan group that reached the deal.

The episode exposed a rift between moderate Democrats who are up for re-election this year in states won by Mr. Trump and their more liberal counterparts.

• Turkey’s military offensive against a Kurdish enclave in Syria has put it on a collision course with the United States, a NATO ally.

It is widely assumed in Ankara that the Turkish government received a green light from Russia to launch the offensive, which relies on Moscow’s agreement to open up the airspace to Turkish jets.

One of our senior editors explains the U.S. impasse. “It’s partly Washington’s fault for pursuing an anti-ISIS strategy that set up the Turkish-Kurdish time bomb that is now going off,” he writes.

(Meanwhile in Germany, there’s a growing debate about arms shipments to Turkey.)

• The World Economic Forum in Davos starts today with a sense of optimism because of waning worries about populism and global economic growth. (There’s also plenty of snow.)

The conversation there is already dominated by one topic: What will President Trump say? The growing threat of cyberattacks is also on the agenda.

While the mood is upbeat, our economic correspondent notes that “those elsewhere on earth can be forgiven for wondering what all this lofty talk has to do with them.”

Here’s more of our coverage and the full schedule.

_____

• In spite of all the snow in Davos, our planet is warming.

Our analysis of more than 3,800 cities shows that about 88 percent recorded higher-than-normal annual mean temperatures last year. Paris was 2.6 degrees Celsius warmer, Moscow was up 1.9 degrees and Berlin rose 1.4 degrees.

• Qatar is in the fight of its life.

Our correspondent explored how the tiny emirate is dealing with a punishing boycott by its neighbors that is meant to rein in its ambitions.

For now, the rich city-state is coping but also discovering that there are some things that money can’t buy. Nothing suggests that the dispute will be resolved anytime soon.

“Remember the Maine!” was the rallying cry of the Spanish-American War. Many North Americans surely remember the Alamo. But has the world forgotten the U.S.S. Pueblo?

On this day in 1968, the Pueblo, a lightly armed Navy intelligence ship, was attacked and seized by North Korean patrol boats. Its crew of 83 servicemen was taken to Pyongyang and charged as spies. Washington denounced the seizure, but could do little: It soon became a tense Cold War standoff.

A Times editorial called the attack “humiliating,” and a prisoner drama — marked by fraught negotiations, forced confessions and propaganda ploys — dragged on for 11 months. Here’s more about the Pueblo incident.

The Americans told of beatings, torture and deprivation, but they still found ways to get back at their captors. They slipped outrageous puns into self-written confessions, such as this one by the ship’s commander, and surreptitiously raised their middle fingers in films and photographs. (The sailors said it was the Hawaiian good luck salute.)

In the end, Washington reluctantly apologized, and the Pueblo crew was home in time for Christmas. The Pueblo itself is still in Pyongyang, where it’s a tourist attraction at the Victorious War Museum.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• President Trump demanded last June that Robert Mueller, the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation, be dismissed, but backed down after the White House counsel threatened to resign.

The president argued that Mr. Mueller had multiple conflicts of interest that disqualified him from overseeing the inquiry into election meddling.

But the White House’s top lawyer, Donald McGahn, told senior officials that firing Mr. Mueller would be catastrophic to Mr. Trump’s presidency. The president later relented.

• Since Ty Cobb joined Mr. Trump’s legal team in July, the president has ratcheted back his criticism of the special counsel. The White House has operated on the premise that the quickest way to clear suspicion was to cooperate with Mr. Mueller.

• President Trump proposed on Thursday a path to citizenship for as many as 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants in exchange for an end to family-based migration policies, a border wall with Mexico and a vast crackdown on those in the country illegally.

But the offer that the White House described as “extremely generous” was immediately rejected by a bipartisan group of lawmakers as well as by immigration advocates. Some dismissed the proposal as an attempt to shut the borders.

Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles.

She wanted to fly, but no U.S. aviation school would admit her. So she taught herself French, moved to France and became the first African-American woman to earn a pilot’s license, in 1921.

Bessie Coleman was born on this day in 1892 in Atlanta, Tex. The daughter of sharecroppers, she was also of Native American descent and was inspired by stories of the Wright brothers and World War I pilots.

Ms. Coleman’s brother told her of seeing Frenchwomen fly when he served in World War I, so she headed across the Atlantic. She earned her international pilot’s license in seven months.

She returned to the U.S. and performed as a stunt pilot, dazzling audiences at air shows — but only those that were open to viewers of her race. “The air is the only place free from prejudice,” she said.

On April 30, 1926, Ms. Coleman was airborne when her biplane flipped over during a test flight. She plummeted to her death from the open cockpit. She was 34.

“Before she died, however, Miss Coleman became a role model for many young black women and, as a consequence, flying became popular among them,” The Times noted in 1985.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Sunday’s mass shooting at a church in rural Texas was the last chapter in a troubled life full of domestic rage.

The gunman, Devin Kelley, was convicted and jailed for attacking his wife and infant stepson in 2010, fracturing the child’s skull. The U.S. military is investigating why the former airman’s conviction was not entered into a database that would have prevented him from buying a gun.

We compared President Trump’s responses to recent attacks. Our Houston bureau chief and a pastor at a nearby church discuss the shooting on our podcast, “The Daily.”

Our Op-Ed columnist Nicholas Kristof looked at ways to reduce shootings. If you have been affected by a such an attack, please get in touch to share any advice you could offer to help others facing such a tragedy.

• Revelations continue from the “Paradise Papers,” a trove of documents from an offshore firm used to obscure wealth.

As Apple’s tax structure, and its reliance on Ireland, came under scrutiny, the tech giant turned to the small British island of Jersey. (According to one estimate, tax strategies like the ones used by Apple cost governments as much as $240 billion a year in lost revenue.)

Throughout the centenary year, we explored the legacy of Communism in a series of Op-Eds, “Red Century.”

Perhaps less noted is how the revolution changed culinary history. Millions of émigrés of the crumbled remains of the Russian Empire took their cuisine with them.

“As the American, wandering a foreign land, longs for ham and eggs country style, so does the Russian exile want borsch, the national Russian soup with his meal,” The Times wrote in 1935. “And in New York he gets it.”

A Parisian cookbook from 1938 described borscht as “a Russian soup made from beef, duck, pork belly, garnished with cabbage julienne and beetroot.” (It also provided a Polish version.)

To this day, restaurants in Hong Kong serve “lor soong tong,” a soup derived from the borscht made by migrants from Russia and Eastern Europe who sought refuge in what was then a British colony.

And just last month, Ukraine sought to widen the soup’s global reach on Twitter: “@Google & @Apple, time to have a borscht emoji!”

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Europe is back. That was the message of some of the Continent’s leaders in speeches at the World Economic Forum that resonated as a rebuttal of President Trump’s unilateralism. (Above, our cartoonist’s take on the gathering in Davos, Switzerland.)

While some at the forum might recoil at Mr. Trump’s speech on Friday, many members of the gathered elite appreciate the additional wealth he has delivered to their coffers. Meanwhile, trade deals that do not include the U.S. are moving ahead.

Among today’s speakers are the leaders of Britain and Israel, and Cyril Ramaphosa, who is widely expected to become South Africa’s next president.

• Before he left for Europe, Mr. Trump ended months of speculation by saying that he was willing to speak under oath with Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Mr. Trump also said that he supported allowing immigrants known as Dreamers to “morph into” citizens over 10 to 12 years. (At the same time, his administration is increasing pressure on so-called sanctuary cities.)

Separately, new campaign filings and news reports suggest that two pro-Trump groups are raising millions, then channeling the money into the Trump Organization and to Trump loyalists.

In honor of Australia Day, Friday’s holiday marking the anniversary of Britain’s arrival Down Under in 1788, we’re looking at one of the country’s most recognizable exports: “G’day, mate!”

Australian National University points to an early use of the greeting in “The Romance of a Station,” a novel from 1889:

“He pulled up, nodding to Alec’s ‘Good-day, Tillidge,’ and replying in a short, morose manner, running his words one into the other, as a bushman does, ‘G’d-day, sir.’”

A century later, the phrase was popularized the world over in a tourism ad campaign featuring Paul Hogan, the Australian actor who would later gain international fame as Crocodile Dundee.

Australians have a long tradition of abbreviating and slackening words and phrases, particularly by adding “ie” to the end.

“Aussie” appears in references from World War I. A book by Gertrude Moberly, recounting the experiences of a nurse, described a “farewell dance for the boys going home to ‘Aussie’ tomorrow.”

And Australians always have their “mates.” The nation’s unique camaraderie, known as mateship, is especially evident during commemorations of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (or Anzacs), the World War I-era fighting force.

Here’s a tale of innovation, of why it’s hard to stand in the way of progress.

Eighty-three years ago, canned beer was sold in Richmond, Va., believed to be a U.S. first. The innovation was soon picked up by a brewer in Wales.

The cans were lighter and cheaper than bottles, and they immediately proved a huge success.

“Sales resistance to beer in cans has been overcome in every section of the country,” The Times reported a few months later. “The product is selling more rapidly than it can be supplied.”

Within two months, the American Can Company was producing 25,000 to 30,000 beer cans every day.

By September, U.S. winemakers sought to package their product in cans, too, to “induce the American consumer to ‘become wine-minded,’ ” The Times reported.

Bottle makers pushed back against the new competition.

At a conference in Atlantic City, they spoke of plans for lighter bottles, and for ones that wouldn’t require a deposit.

Regardless of what it was packaged in, beer was popular in post-Prohibition America. Sales of bottled and canned beer grew more than 50 percent in the first half of 1936 from the previous year.

By 1970, beer cans had overtaken bottles.

Patrick Boehler contributed reporting.
