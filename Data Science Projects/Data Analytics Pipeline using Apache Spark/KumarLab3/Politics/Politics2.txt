It will be tempting for most critics to approach ÂThe Female PersuasionÂ through the lens of the current political climate Â perhaps nigh impossible for them not to. Meg WolitzerÂs 12th novel begins with a campus assault that leads to a protest that leads to an intergenerational feminist debate that takes a turn for the toxic. ItÂs as if a healthy portion of the Twittersphere were aggregated, swallowed and spit back out as the plot of a literary novel.

And who will blame these critics? The novelÂs protagonist, Greer Kadetsky Â who starts the book as a faceless college freshman Âabsorbed in her own unhappiness, practically curating itÂ Â is the living embodiment of todayÂs growing number of young white women whose own processes of politicization are equally inspiring and problematic. Her budding friendship with a self-actualized queer girl named Zee Eisenstat, as well as an utterly clinical and horrific groping at a frat party, set Greer Â all the while consumed with her boyfriend, who is miles away at Princeton Â on the activist path.

And it is this path that leads her straight to Faith Frank, a notorious figure in the womenÂs empowerment movement who reads as part Gloria Steinem, part Eve Ensler, part Dame Helen Mirren. FaithÂs confidence, passion and good humanitarian deeds (which she allows Greer to join in as part of her undertaking) come to define the next half-decade of GreerÂs life, as her bond with Zee and her seemingly idyllic romance with said boyfriend, Cory, fracture and eventually combust.

The novelÂs timeliness cannot be overstated, but it also invites a bigger question: What do we as readers, as a society, want from our fiction? Is it enough for it just to speak to the zeitgeist? Or are we also committed to words working their magic and characters growing hotter to the touch with each passing page? Of GreerÂs interest in language, Wolitzer Â a noted bard of middle-class malaise Â writes, ÂAll written words danced in a chain for her.Â And the same could be said of the author herself, who writes in warm, specific prose that neither calls attention to itself nor ignores the mandate of the best books: to tell us things we know in ways we never thought to know them.

Of all the political threads that permeate ÂThe Female Persuasion,Â the one that interests me most is the challenge of intergenerational feminism. This reviewer must confess to having met Wolitzer, through our mutual mentor Nora Ephron, whose humanity and specificity can often be felt in WolitzerÂs work Â here, particularly in the woeful characters who populate the student lounge at the fictional Ryland University, like the girl who needs help deciding whether diarrhea constitutes a medical emergency. (It is no wonder the first feature film Ephron directed, ÂThis Is My Life,Â was based on a Wolitzer novel.) This connection is a reminder of what can be nurturing, inclusive and essential about the interweaving of ideas between women of varying ages, of how feminism expands rather than shrinks, while also sometimes forgetting to make room for what doesnÂt resemble itself.

But as Greer and FaithÂs relationship takes on a new dimension, the skeptical sneer of the elder meets the righteous judgment of the younger. I am thinking, in particular, of a scene where Greer confronts Faith with a shocking professional revelation as Faith is having her hair colored at a high-end salon, her head covered in foils, Âhooked up not with electrodes but with a conduit to youth and beauty.Â It doesnÂt feel like an accident that the bookÂs mentor is named Faith, as that is what she demands of her followers, blind and without reservation Â and itÂs a testament to WolitzerÂs skill that this does not come off as ham-handed. By the time Greer understands the compromises Faith has had to make to build her woman-saving empire, sheÂs so deeply invested that she can hardly afford to walk away. Like one who is afraid to admit her religion is a fraud, she is faced with having to keep the faith.

When this book is not examining the uniqueness of Greer and FaithÂs dynamic, it is speaking to the larger issue of ambition: who has it, what curtails it and what it means to reframe it. Greer and Zee share activist leanings, but GreerÂs nice-girl image of herself is tested when Zee too wants access to FaithÂs world. CoryÂs promising post-Ivy League life is upended and then made small by tragedy. And then thereÂs Faith, whose demand that the world give her the chance to be one of its conquering heroes is the definition of a certain kind of ambition Â graceful, guileless and vaguely sinister. The book itself is an ambitious 456 pages, tight but inclusive, and deserves to be placed on shelves alongside such ornate modern novels beginning in college as ÂA Little Life,Â ÂThe Secret HistoryÂ and ÂThe Marriage Plot.Â

The conversation IÂd been hearing around the book before I even received my galley was about its resonance within our current political climate, one that is so focused on issues of womenÂs consent, control and intersectionality. ItÂs all there to parse, and parsed it will be. But when all is said and done, Wolitzer is an infinitely capable creator of human identities that are as real as the type on this page, and her love of her characters shines more brightly than any agenda. People Â loving them, knowing them, letting them shatter and rebuild us again Â are WolitzerÂs politics, and thatÂs something to vote for.

Omarosa Manigault Newman, a three-time contestant on NBCÂs ÂThe Apprentice,Â volunteered to enter a surreal house in which minor celebrities, acting out under constant media surveillance, conspire to eject their rivals one by one.

Then she went on ÂCelebrity Big Brother.Â

That it took the second experience (a CBS reality show) to get Ms. Newman to open up about the first (her tenure in Donald J. TrumpÂs White House) may not be the model of civic discourse that the founders envisioned. But itÂs the one Americans voted for, and maybe the one we deserve.

Thus, one of the most dramatic exit interviews of this year-old administration transpired on a cushy sectional couch in the ÂBig BrotherÂ house, between Ms. Newman, the former director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison, and Ross Mathews, a.k.a. ÂRoss the InternÂ from Jay LenoÂs ÂTonightÂ show.

As Mr. Mathews pried, in full-on Oprah mode, Ms. Newman broke into tears. She described being wracked with guilt over the fears the administration has stirred up, Âhaunted by tweetsÂ from a volatile president and stymied in her efforts to be a calming influence.

ÂWe are worried,Â Mr. Mathews said. ÂBut I need you to say, ÂNo, itÂs going to be O.K.ÂÂ

ÂNo, itÂs going to not be O.K.,Â Ms. Newman said. ÂItÂs not. ItÂs so bad.Â

Once one of Mr. TrumpÂs most loyal boosters Â she told a ÂFrontlineÂ documentary crew before the election that Âevery critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President TrumpÂ Â now said she wouldnÂt vote for him again, Âin a million years, never.Â

Her confession was punctuated by the kind of distant-thunder soundtrack that played during boardroom smackdowns on ÂThe Apprentice.Â

It was a Frost/Nixon interview for the Trump era, when politics and reality TV have become inseparable and indistinguishable. Television, from ÂFox and FriendsÂ in the morning to ÂBig BrotherÂ at night, is now a fourth branch of government.

In a ÂGood Morning AmericaÂ interview in December, after she was escorted off the White House grounds after reports of clashes with senior staff, Ms. Newman made only a tepid reference to ÂuncomfortableÂ situations on the job.

But she opened up in the company of her peers. One of them, the actress Keshia Knight-Pulliam of ÂThe Cosby Show,Â was also once a contestant on ÂThe Celebrity Apprentice,Â where she was fired by Mr. Trump for not having called Bill Cosby to help with a challenge.

When Ms. Knight-Pulliam criticized Ms. Newman for standing by Âthe hate that that campaign kind of incited,Â Ms. Newman compared her loyalty with Ms. Knight-PulliamÂs supporting Mr. Cosby through numerous accusations of rape. ÂOnly you know the inner workings of your relationship with Mr. Cosby,Â Ms. Newman said. ÂThatÂs the same thing with me and Mr. Trump.Â

I would not have pegged ÂCelebrity Big BrotherÂ as the show where, in the Trump and #MeToo eras, America would work through the ethics of enabling powerful men accused of abuses. But here we are.

There is a kind of literary symmetry to Ms. NewmanÂs smiting her former boss with the very tools he taught her to use. Omarosa was the villain of ÂThe Apprentice,Â but she played the game in the most Trumpian way.

She recognized that the show was a contest not of business acumen but of getting and leveraging attention. She created conflict in the belief that chaos yields opportunity. She denied mistakes even when sheÂd made them on camera. She didnÂt win the season, but she won the greater prize of fame.

She was so successful that Mr. Trump had her back two more times and also produced, and appeared on, a TV One dating show for her Â ÂDonald J. Trump Presents the Ultimate MergerÂ Â all before hiring her for a White House position whose duties few people were able to describe.

A few caveats are in order about Ms. NewmanÂs ÂWelcome to the ResistanceÂ moment. Reality shows are edited for maximum sensation. Her warnings were dire but unspecific. As a contestant on ÂThe Apprentice,Â she learned that drama is what saves you from the editing room floor. She might be interested in making a book deal, or simply in repairing her public brand. As Mr. Mathews put it: ÂI donÂt know if itÂs real. Would you trust her?Â

Those might have been stronger rebuttals to Ms. NewmanÂs comments than what the deputy White House press secretary, Raj Shah, offered Thursday to a reporter from Â of course Â CBS.

ÂOmarosa was fired three times on ÂThe Apprentice,Â and this is the fourth time weÂve let her go,Â he said. It was a boomerang insult that suggested that the Trump administration is part of the same long-running narrative as ÂThe Apprentice,Â and raised the question of why she was hired in the first place.

But to suggest that Ms. Newman might have been playing to the cameras would have required the administration of Mr. Trump Â who campaigned on the decisive-leader image that ÂThe ApprenticeÂ stage-managed for him Â to recognize that reality TV can convey an inaccurate impression of people.

How much more Ms. Newman has to say, and how much time sheÂll have to say it, is yet to be seen. But sheÂs safe from being voted out of the house for now, having conveniently won immunity from the first ejection.

The network, if not the White House, must be happy. The Wednesday premiere of the three-week series was the highest-rated show of the night. During the 2016 Republican primary, the CBS chairman Leslie Moonves said of Mr. TrumpÂs campaign, ÂIt may not be good for America, but itÂs damn good for CBS.Â

He was more right than he knew.
