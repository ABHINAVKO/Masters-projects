The border between the United States and Mexico is in the news every day, in ongoing debates about immigration and spending on security initiatives. But what is it like to visit destinations along the border? To find out, writers for Travel spent time in five pairings of places: Brownsville, Tex., and Matamoros, Mexico; Big Bend National Park and Boquillas; San Diego and Tijuana; Nogales, Ariz., and Nogales, Mexico; and El Paso and Ciudad JuÃ¡rez.

As I sat at the market in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez on a weekday in January, it all seemed so familiar: The clanking of the reusable glass bottles; the greeter hollering for visitors to sit in his corner of the restaurant; the smell of grease meandering through the upstairs eatery where Axl Rose was screaming at me from a jukebox. All this while vendors downstairs sold T-shirts with the image of the late singer Juan Gabriel emblazoned across the chest while others negotiated with visitors over the price of a homemade poncho featuring the logo of the Dallas Cowboys.

The images of daylong excursions to Ciudad JuÃ¡rez with my father as a child made their way into my memory, where they collided with the flashbacks of a teenage me sharing buckets of beers with friends who were convinced that going south of the border for a day was more important than sitting through biology.

I was one of tens of thousands to cross into Mexico from El Paso that week, challenging the notion that lawlessness in Mexican border cities keeps Americans at bay (but gone are the days of oral declarations; a passport is now required to re-enter the United States as the federal government continues to beef up border enforcement).

Even in tougher times, many of us never stopped coming here. It is because there are thousands of El Pasoans like me whose ties that bind them to Ciudad JuÃ¡rez are familial or economic, or both. The effects reverberate well north of the Rio Grande. Texas is MexicoÂs No. 1 trade partner, and the El Paso customs district saw $85.5 billion in two-way trade with Mexico, from January to November 2017. That is the second-highest total in the United States behind LaredoÂs $270 billion.

In the heart of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez I crossed the street to where the parishioners from the centuries-old Catedral de Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe were walking through the adjacent park, the Plaza de Armas. Guards were closing up shop at the cityÂs old government office, now the Centro Municipal de las Artes.

Both are open to the public, and are just two of the museums and tourist attractions city officials and street vendors hope will lure visitors back to a city considered by lawmakers and human rights groups as one of the worldÂs most dangerous just six years ago.

Two blocks east on Avenida 16 de Septiembre is a museum that captures the spirit of one of the greatest episodes in MexicoÂs history, the Museo de la Revolucion de la Frontera. The museum occupies what was the customs building during the civil war that raged in Mexico from 1910 to 1920. Recent renovations have transformed it with a modern sleekness.

Photographs of Mexican revolutionary figures like Francisco Madero, Venustiano Carranza and Francisco ÂPanchoÂ Villa in different areas of revolutionary JuÃ¡rez highlight the importance of the city during the war. There is also an emphasis on how the Americans were responsible for some of the mayhem. Such is the case with the exhibition dedicated to Gen. John J. Pershing, who led his so-called ÂPunitive ExpeditionÂ in pursuit of Villa after the Mexican rebel leader led his forces into Columbus, N.M.

And although the writers John Reed and Ambrose Bierce are perhaps the most widely known Americans who were fascinated enough by the war in Mexico to become a part of it, the M.U.R.E.F. instead dedicates space to local photographers and writers like Melville Jean Herskovits, Harvey Kiefer and Esther Eva Strauss, whose curiosity and dedication to photojournalism helped document the war for readers in Texas and beyond.

After leaving the museum and walking back toward downtownÂs Paso Del Norte bridge, I realized there remains a sense of adventure associated with going into Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, which I assume could still be slightly overwhelming for new visitors. Though violence has decreased significantly, the sight of a federal police truck carrying masked soldiers clutching semiautomatic rifles can still be somewhat jarring to visitors who are not accustomed to it.

I spotted two of these conducting routine patrols before my last stop on this day trip: the Kentucky Club. The bar has been in business since the 1920s and was frequented by Americans in need of a beer, whiskey or tequila during Prohibition. It has retained its reputation as a laid-back place for patrons on both sides of the Rio Grande, and was one of the few pubs that didnÂt shut its doors during the drug cartel wars that raged in the city from 2008 to 2011. You can stay here for a beer or two, or one of their famous margaritas, or spend hours on end reading about its famous patrons and watching the flat-screen televisions above the hand-carved wooden bar. As the evening wears on, available seats are fewer and the music louder.

Farther away from the cathedral and the museums Ciudad JuÃ¡rez offers up more for visitors willing to take a cab, Uber or drive themselves into the city.

Villa del Mar or Los Arcos are just two of the restaurants here that offer affordable seafood dishes.

Villa del Mar was a family favorite growing up. The owners opened a branch in El Paso after the drug violence began but the original location is still up and running in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez.

This was my first time at Los Arcos, recommended by a family friend. A delectable dish of bacon-wrapped stuffed shrimp, a beer and a bottle of water was less than 350 pesos, or about $19.

Closer to the Bridge of the Americas and Chamizal Park, Viva Mexico! stages a two-hour-long pageant that celebrates everything from MexicoÂs indigenous roots to its vaquero culture with song and dance. That follows a buffet dinner that has become so popular that reservations are recommended.

Much of El PasoÂs identity is rooted in its remoteness. It is in a different time zone than most of Texas. It is closer to the capitals of three other states Â Arizona, New Mexico and Chihuahua Â than it is to Austin. It is surrounded by mountains and desert that offer few clear distinctions as to where the city in Texas ends and the one in Mexico begins.

I was born and raised here. My momÂs house is in the Austin Terrace neighborhood and my fatherÂs house was two blocks from the eastern foothills of the Franklin Mountains, in a part of the city that used to be called Chivas Town (so named because it was where goat farmers lived before the neighborhood was incorporated by the city).

After moving away for school and work for a number of years, I realized I had not taken advantage of what the Franklin Mountains had to offer. So when I came back, I set out to explore the hiking trails and mountain peaks my friends brag about on social media during their bike rides and other excursions.

The mountains have rugged options for outdoor entertainmentÂtheyÂre one of the premier spots for paragliding in the United StatesÂand the Wyler Aerial Tramway takes hikers and other visitors to Ranger Peak, 5,632 feet above sea level. From the top, Fort Bliss is visible just beyond the middle-class neighborhoods of Central and Northeast El Paso.

The base, one of the largest in the country, is home to the First Armored Division of the United States Army and spreads across Texas and New Mexico on more than a million acres of federally owned land. Its history is on view at the Old Ironsides Museum on the base, which features exhibits about the history of the base and the division, and rationing efforts by Americans during World War II. A plaque next to an Abrams M1 tank honors Sgt. Israel Devora Garcia, who was born in Zacatecas, Mexico, and raised in nearby Clint, Tex. He died in combat operations in Iraq in 2006. (Admission to the museum is free. Visitors must get a pass to the base before entering; itÂs easy but can be time-consuming on weekends.)

Fort Bliss is one reason so many El Pasoans are so patriotic (one of the cityÂs main highways, Route 54, was designated the Patriot Freeway during the first Gulf War).

Like Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, El Paso is experiencing its own downtown renovation, which includes the successful return of minor league baseball to the city. The El Paso Chihuahuas, the Triple-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres, who play at Southwest University Park. The nearby Deadbeach Brewery is just one of a half-dozen or so trendy spots that offer up craft beers and food-truck meals (at Deadbeach, I like the I.P.A.).

El Paso is as well known for its Mexican food as it is for its mountains. It is not that people claim the enchilada or menudo was invented here, they just believe they are better in El Paso than anywhere else. Exhibit A: the L & J CafÃ©, which has been around since 1927. Out-of-towners are quick to say the chicken molÃ© is the best they have ever tried, but for me the chicken enchiladas are second to none.

The Tap Bar is what I consider one of the best haunts in El Paso, where itÂs hard to tell if it is 8 a.m. or 8 p.m. once youÂre inside. The jukebox will go from Los Tigres del Norte or Marty Robbins to Metallica within minutes.

In addition to mountains, desert sunsets and the legend of Pancho Villa, residents of both Ciudad JuÃ¡rez and El Paso have something the rest of the other cities along the Rio Grande donÂt: New Mexico.

Less than 10 minutes from downtown El Paso is the Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino. On the way there, people cross south of the Rio Grande but remain in the United States. On my first visit I won enough to gamble and drink for free, which wasnÂt bad for a lazy Sunday.

Because it is on the border, the entertainment doesnÂt consist of Elvis impersonators or a tribute to the Rat Pack. It is something with more of a local flavor Â a live mariachi band.

EDUCATED A Memoir By Tara Westover 335 pp. Random House. $28.

America has struggled with the urban-rural divide for centuries, stretching all the way back to when ManhattanÂs own Alexander Hamilton fixed his sights on backwoods whiskey distilleries as a revenue source for the new Republic, prompting rebellion. But one could make the case that the divide has never consumed us as much as it does today. The political parties are aligned more than ever around blue metropolises and red spaces in between. Economic growth is now so glaringly concentrated in certain urban areas that it has reignited the age-old debate over staying vs. going. Should the young and ambitious from struggling small towns and cities be encouraged to seek their fortune in the hotbeds of dynamism and overpriced Sunday brunch, or does this only sunder family ties and hasten the collapse of the interior?

It was this dilemma that helped make J. D. VanceÂs ÂHillbilly ElegyÂ a runaway best seller in 2016 Â the tale of a young man whoÂd overcome the dysfunctions of his transplanted Appalachian family to ascend to the Ivy League and Silicon Valley, with plenty of culture shocks along the way. Yet Tara WestoverÂs new tale of escape, ÂEducated,Â makes VanceÂs seem tame by comparison. Where Vance wrote affectingly of showing up at Ohio State and Yale Law with the limited preparation provided by his middling schools in Middletown, Ohio, Westover describes showing up in college with no schooling at all. Where Vance describes a family contending with the all-too-common burdens of substance abuse, Westover lays bare a family cursed by ideological mania and outlandish physical trauma. If VanceÂs memoir offered street-heroin-grade drama, WestoverÂs is carfentanil, the stuff that tranquilizes elephants.

The extremity of WestoverÂs upbringing emerges gradually through her telling, which only makes the telling more alluring and harrowing. The basics are these: Now in her early 30s, she was the youngest of seven in a survivalist family in the shadow of a mountain in a Mormon pocket of southeastern Idaho. Her father, Gene (a pseudonym), grew up on a farm at the base of the mountain, the son of a hot-tempered father, and moved up the slope with his wife, the product of a more genteel upbringing in the nearby small town. Gene sustained his growing family by building barns and hay sheds and by scrapping metal in his junkyard; his wife, Faye (also a pseudonym), chipped in with her income from mixing up herbal remedies and from her reluctant work as an unlicensed midwifeÂs assistant and then midwife.

During his 20s, GeneÂs edgy and not uncharismatic intensity morphed into politically charged paranoia, fueled by what the reader is led to presume is a severe case of bipolar disorder. Around the age of 30, he pulled his eldest children from school to protect them from the Illuminati, though they, at least, had the benefit of a birth certificate, an indulgence the youngest four would be denied. In theory, the children were being home-schooled; in reality, there was virtually no academic instruction to speak of. They learned to read from the Bible, the Book of Mormon and the speeches of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. The only science book in the house was for young children, full of glossy illustrations. The bulk of their time was spent helping their parents at work. Barely into her teens, Westover graduated from helping her mom mix remedies and birth babies to sorting scrap with her dad, who had the unnerving habit of inadvertently hitting her with pieces heÂd tossed.

Getting hit with a steel cylinder square in the gut was the least of the risks in the Westover household. The book is, among other things, a catalog of job-site horrors: fingers lost, legs gashed, bodies horribly burned. No pointy-headed bureaucrat could make a stronger case for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration than do the unregulated Westovers with their many calamities. Making matters worse is GeneÂs refusal to allow any of the injured and wounded (himself included) to seek medical attention beyond his wifeÂs tinctures Â ÂGodÂs pharmacyÂ Â a refusal that also greatly exacerbates the effects of two terrible car accidents. ÂGod and his angels are here, working right alongside us,Â he tells Westover. ÂThey wonÂt let you get hurt.Â When she gets tonsillitis, he tells her to stand outside with her mouth open so that the sun can work its magic. She does, for a month.

As time goes on, the conflict between father and daughter gathers as inevitably as the lengthening fall shadows from BuckÂs Peak above. GeneÂs fervor and paranoia are undiminished by the failure of the world to end at Y2K, despite his ample preparations. (Westover offers the pathos-filled image of her father sitting expressionless in front of ÂThe HoneymoonersÂ as the world ticks quietly onward.) Meanwhile, she is starting to test the boundaries of an upbringing more tightly constricted than she can even begin to imagine. Her venture into a local dance class ends with her father condemning the groupÂs painfully modest performance outfits as whorish. Encouraged by an older brother who started studying covertly and eventually left for college, Westover attempts to do likewise, reading deep into her fatherÂs books on the 19th-century Mormon prophets. ÂThe skill I was learning was a crucial one, the patience to read things I could not yet understand,Â she writes with characteristic understatement. (Only very occasionally is WestoverÂs assured prose marred by unnecessary curlicues.) As if her fatherÂs tyranny is not enough, she must contend also with sadistic physical attacks from a different brother, whose instability was worsened by a 12-foot headfirst plunge onto rebar in yet another Westover workplace accident.

Tara makes her first big step toward liberation by, remarkably, doing well enough on the ACT to gain admission to Brigham Young University. (ÂIt proves one thing at least,Â her father says grudgingly. ÂOur home school is as good as any public education.Â) There, she is shocked by the profane habits of her classmates, like the roommate who wears pink plush pajamas with ÂJuicyÂ emblazoned on the rear, and in turn shocks her classmates with her ignorance, never more so than when she asks blithely in art history class what the Holocaust was. (Other new discoveries for her: Napoleon, Martin Luther King Jr., the fact that Europe is not a country.) Such excruciating moments do not keep professors from recognizing her talent and voracious hunger to learn; soon enough, sheÂs off to a fellowship at Cambridge University, where a renowned professor Â a Holocaust expert, no less Â canÂt help exclaiming when he meets her: ÂHow marvelous. ItÂs as if IÂve stepped into ShawÂs ÂPygmalion.ÂÂ

Westover eventually makes it to Harvard for another fellowship and then back to Cambridge to pursue her Ph.D. in history. Even then, sheÂs not yet fully sprung, so deeply rooted are the tangled familial claims of loyalty, guilt, shame and, yes, love. It is only when the final, wrenching break from most of her family arrives that one realizes just how courageous this testimonial really is. These disclosures will take a toll. But one is also left convinced that the costs are worth it. By the end, Westover has somehow managed not only to capture her unsurpassably exceptional upbringing, but to make her current situation seem not so exceptional at all, and resonant for many others. She is but yet another young person who left home for an education, now views the family she left across an uncomprehending ideological canyon, and isnÂt going back.

MONTREAL Â Since arriving back in Montreal after nearly three decades abroad, one of the most striking changes IÂve noticed has been the seeming retreat of the separatist movement here. The younger generation seems far more focused on becoming the Quebecois Steve Jobs than in fomenting revolution.

So as I began my Quebec road trip this week in my hometown, I sought out Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, a charismatic young proponent of QuebecÂs independence from Canada. My aim was to try and understand how the movement has evolved since the culture wars of the 1980s, when the province was buffeted by the aftermath of a referendum on independence.

Mr. Nadeau-Dubois is a proud left-winger, who compares his politics to that of Bernie Sanders, Jeremy Corbyn or Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon. He was one of the leaders of the 2012 ÂMaple Spring,Â huge student protests against an increase in university tuition fees that galvanized a generation of young Quebecois. He is also unrepentant about Quebec pursuing its national sovereignty.

ÂQuebec needs to change the rules of the game, and that is not possible when Canada is based on a system in which Queen Elizabeth is the head of state and the constitutional system is centuries old,Â he told me on Monday over a coffee in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie, a gentrifying working-class neighborhood. It is part of the district he represents in the provinceÂs National Assembly as one of three members from his left-wing party, Quebec Solidaire.

While he acknowledged that the separatist movement was Ânot at its peak,Â he stressed that about 30 percent to 40 percent of Quebecois supported an independent Quebec, according to recent polls.

Moreover, he argued that QuebecÂs independence would help neutralize the provinceÂs simmering far right by expunging easy nationalism and xenophobia in favor of cultural affirmation and human rights. Having an independent country, Mr. Nadeau-Dubois said, would mitigate against fear of the other.

IÂd be interested to hear what younger Canadians think of the separatist movement today. Please share your thoughts with me here, as well other ideas you might have for people I should meet and places I should visit to gain a richer sense of QuebecÂs identity today.

Mr. Nadeau-Dubois embodies a new strain in Quebecois politics, seeking to tap into the younger generationÂs appetite for radicalism and change even as voters worldwide look for alternatives to mainstream political parties. He is a Quebecois anti-Trump for the digital age, using social media to mobilize his legions of young supporters.

ÂWe support feminism, indigenous and LGBT rights; we are pro-choice; and we believe that the state must regain control over parts of the economy, including some natural resources,Â he said.

The son of a unionist activist father and a labor lawyer mother, Mr. Nadeau-Dubois said he received his political education at a young age, at union protests with his parents. Political apathy was not an option.

Today, to unwind, he makes couscous and plays floor hockey. He also wrote ÂIn Defiance,Â a book about his experiences during the 2012 demonstrations.

Asked about his feelings about another young and charismatic politician named Justin Trudeau, Mr. Nadeau-Dubois became visibly agitated, dismissing Mr. Trudeau as a talented retail politician who has little substance.

ÂHis progressivism is a facade,Â he said. ÂIt is nice words. It is bling bling.Â

Mr. Nadeau-Dubois said the most emotional moment of the 2012 protests came when a young Lebanese-Canadian woman in a head scarf approached him at a protest where 300,000 people had massed in the streets. He said the young woman told him that, while the strike had divided her family, her mother had come to appreciate its importance as a struggle for accessible education for everyone.

ÂShe told me that it was the strike that had made her mom a Quebecois,Â he recalled, his face bursting into a smile.

My meeting with Mr. Nadeau-Dubois capped two days in Montreal, where I visited Martin PicardÂs Cabane Ã  Sucre Au Pied de Cochon for decadent dishes including a three-layer almond foie gras cake; compiled a playlist of music for my journey with songs suggested by readers; and met with Phyllis Lambert, the 91-year-old architect and philanthropist. The daughter of Samuel Bronfman of the Seagram distillery empire, she, at age 27, persuaded her father to build the towering Seagram Building on Park Avenue in New York, a transformative work of 20th-century architecture.

As you read this, I am on my way to Maniwaki, where I am going to reconnect with Cezin Nottaway, a boisterous Indigenous chef. I plan to meet her on the Indigenous reserve of Kitigan Zibi, where the Algonquin tribe has been living for generations.

Ms. Nottaway is a passionate advocate for Indigenous rights, and I plan to talk to her about the anguish after the killing of Colten Boushie, a 22-year-old Indigenous man shot dead by a Saskatchewan farmer, Gerald Stanley, who was found not guilty of murder.

She and I will join my colleagues from The New York TimesÂs Race/Related team in a Facebook Live chat at 9 p.m. Eastern Time. Please join us at facebook.com/nytimes.

If you have questions for her, or ideas for places I should go to understand QuebecÂs Indigenous communities, IÂd love to hear from you.

Follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, as well as on The TimesÂs Reader Center, where I will be posting dispatches of my journey. And donÂt forget to sign up for the Canada newsletter.

SYDNEY, Australia Â AustraliaÂs boys-club political culture appeared in recent weeks to receive a healthy dose of #MeToo disruption.

First, Robert Doyle, the lord mayor of Melbourne, resigned after two members of the City Council accused him of groping them. Days later, Barnaby Joyce, the deputy prime minister, stepped down after he confessed to an affair with a staff member and was then accused by another woman of harassment.

The scandal surrounding Mr. Joyce even prompted Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to ban members of Parliament from having sex with their subordinates Â the first time in five years that the rules on ministerial conduct had been updated.

But according to women who work in the halls of Australian power, the scandals in February were but a tiny sampling of the pervasive culture of sexual harassment endemic to the countryÂs politics.

Less than a third of the Australian Parliament is female. Canberra, the capital, is frequently described as an old boyÂs club, with many menÂs connections Â and attitudes about sexual conduct Â starting in the elite universities and the youth wings of the major parties that guide the politically ambitious through their 20s.

ÂIt was clear that a bully boy culture had accumulated over many, many years,Â said Ellen Sandell, a Greens politician and member of the Victorian State Parliament. ÂItÂs got to start somewhere.Â

That culture of harassment and protection for powerful men, women say, has prevented more accusers from speaking publicly about encounters with politicians. It has also, they say, stymied a more robust #MeToo movement Â akin to those that have rattled Washington and Hollywood Â from taking hold.

ÂI know it prevented a number of other victims and witnessesÂ feeling safe to come forward,Â said Tessa Sullivan, a former Melbourne City Council member who accused Mr. Doyle of harassment. ÂA number of politicians knew about my abuse and tried to deter me from speaking out.Â

AustraliaÂs universities are in the early phases of a reckoning.

Over the past few years, students at the University of Sydney, Australian National University and on several other campuses have mobilized against Ârape culture,Â drawing attention to a lack of punishment for sexual assault and harassment.

Their efforts led to a nationwide survey of 31,000 university students in which 51 percent said they were sexually harassed at least once in 2016. Advocates said the actual figure might be even higher; in most cases, neither the victims nor bystanders report the episodes Â often because they feel nothing will be done.

Many Australian women a generation removed said it was at least as bad or worse during their student days. And, they said, the culture of student politics did not help.

Each of AustraliaÂs main political parties has an active youth wing Â the Young Liberals promote themselves to anyone ages 16 to 31; Young Labor focuses on anyone under 26 Â and their efforts often overlap with on-campus campaigns.

Many lawmakers started out in this milieu, with student bodies or union boards, before moving to staffing roles, party offices or legislatures. Three of AustraliaÂs five most recent prime ministers Â Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott and John Howard Â began their political careers as students at the University of Sydney.

The dynamics of power in these groups have not been equal. Women make up only 29 percent of the Young Liberals membership, according to the groupÂs website. Student leaders say men tend to dominate the senior ranks across parties and campuses.

Regular gatherings of young people in politics Â like the annual National Union of Students conference in December Â are also notorious for alcohol-fueled inappropriate behavior.

ÂAt one of them, a Queensland Labor man threatened to rape me as I was walking back to my room,Â said Tammy Franks, a Greens member of the South Australian Legislative Council, who was active in student politics in the Â90s. ÂI was on the sexual harassment and grievance committee, and there was a lot of that type of behavior.Â

Politicians have carried their university-bred attitudes up the ranks for decades.

Jacqui Munro, a former Liberal staff member in New South Wales who joined the party in 2011, says the Âmixture of older adults and young staffersÂ in many political workplaces can produce situations where professional and personal boundaries are poorly defined.

Mr. Joyce, the deputy prime minister, ended up having an extramarital affair with a younger member of his staff Â thatÂs the extreme. But there are other problems with combining power, proximity and desire.

ÂCloseness can sometimes be misread, especially if alcoholÂs involved,Â Ms. Munro said. ÂPeople can be inappropriately handsy, and sometimes get away with things because itÂs considered a bit too difficult to manage in a long-term sense. You just sort of address it quietly.Â

That tendency to Âaddress it quietlyÂ Â driven in part by the expectation of party loyalty Â often works to preserve the careers of predatory men while women who lodge allegations frequently face an intense backlash. One of the women who accused Mr. Joyce of harassment (a claim he denies) was identified publicly by The Australian, a national conservative newspaper, without her consent.

And public shaming Â also common on university campuses Â frequently leads to perpetual silence, or whispering.

Ms. Sullivan, the former Melbourne council member whose allegation helped topple the cityÂs mayor (he denies the accusation), said women working in Australian politics frequently warn one another privately about male colleaguesÂ conduct, but are often reluctant to accuse their harassers publicly.

ÂFemale politicians,Â she said, understand that they have Âto take steps to protect themselves from being violated.Â

The threats and abuse span parties and states.

Ms. Sandell, the Victorian Parliament member, made headlines in 2016 when she called out sexist bullying on the chamberÂs floor. Sexual harassment had become so pervasive, she said, tour guides stopped allowing primary school students to watch debates taking place in the chamber.

In Canberra last year, a young volunteer accused the Greens party of mishandling her complaint about an older party member whom she accused of sexually assaulting her on election night.

In South Australia, Ms. Franks said she, too, sees signs of a Âtoxic culture.Â

ÂPeople act like spoiled teenagers, and because they have a lot of power they think they can get away with it,Â she said. ÂItÂs like ÂMean GirlsÂ in reverse. ÂMean Blokes.ÂÂ

AustraliaÂs main political parties, in the wake of scandal after scandal, have said they are trying to improve their relations with women.

But with the issue confronted only weakly for years, many women in and out of Australian politics say the country must do more to hold men accountable at every phase of life Â and to ensure that women are not pushed aside by a culture of abuse.

ÂMy advice for women who wish to join politics is to find your voice before joining,Â Ms. Sullivan said. ÂYou will need bravery.Â

But, she added, Âplease do give it a go, because we need more women to help shape the world we all live in.Â
