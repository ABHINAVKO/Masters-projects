ALIVE IN SHAPE AND COLOR 17 Paintings by Great Artists and the Stories They Inspired Edited by Lawrence Block Illustrated. 310 pp. Pegasus Books. $25.95.

On its surface, the idea sounds like a good one: commission fiction writers to create short stories inspired by famous artworks. Between the covers, the reality is something decidedly more equivocal. WhatÂs the purpose of such stories? How do they relate to the artworks theyÂre pegged to?

ÂAlive in Shape and Color: 17 Paintings by Great Artists and the Stories They Inspired,Â a new anthology compiled and edited by the writer Lawrence Block, raises these questions without providing clear answers. Block enlisted 16 colleagues to join him in writing stories based on artworks of their choosing (two of which are sculptures and one of which is a print). The book is a follow-up to his previous effort in this vein, ÂIn Sunlight or in Shadow,Â a 2016 compilation of stories inspired by Edward Hopper paintings.

The most interesting aspect of ÂAlive in Shape and ColorÂ is the range of approaches taken by the authors. Some, like Jonathan Santlofer, use the contents of paintings as general reference images, visual moments that surface within charactersÂ minds or memories. Others incorporate the specific artworks into their narratives: S.J. RozanÂs captive protagonist communes with Katsushika HokusaiÂs ÂThe Great Wave,Â and Kristine Kathryn Rusch imagines the story of the Weather Underground members who bombed RodinÂs ÂThe ThinkerÂ in Cleveland in 1970. Still other contributors use their artworks as starting points that often help set the tone of a story: David MorrellÂs contribution doesnÂt explicitly evoke van GoghÂs ÂCypressesÂ but instead borrows the fact of the artistÂs madness to tell the tale of a painter named Van Dorn who was driven insane by what he saw in a grove of cypress trees.

As these snippets suggest, the stories in ÂAlive in Shape and ColorÂ veer toward high-stakes drama; Block is a crime writer, and here he has gravitated to his own kind. Death (or impending death) is the most consistent plot device; nearly all the stories contain it Â or war, abuse, violence, or depravity. This makes for some page-turners, but it also imposes a wearying sameness on the book. A more varied group of writers could probably dream up a more wide-ranging and satisfying collection. (Surely the prehistoric cave paintings of Lascaux have further mystery to impart beyond Jeffery DeaverÂs archaeologist couple trapped and killed by a jealous ex.)

One problem seems to be a lack of imagination in constructing a book whose foundation is, essentially, the potency of imagination. The vast majority of the selected artworks were made by men living in the West (mostly in the 19th and 20th centuries). The writers, as well as the editor, appear to be white, and fewer than half are women (one is Lawrence BlockÂs daughter). The female protagonists tend to be either victims or unhinged (especially when on their periods, as in Thomas PluckÂs story). Perhaps the bookÂs greatest strength is inadvertent: It reminds us how badly in need of updating our canons are.

Another problem, less easily solved, is the difficulty inherent in translating one creative medium into another. The stories in ÂAlive in Shape and ColorÂ incorporate art but for the most part arenÂt about it; instead, the paintings function as storytelling devices. The two exceptions come from Warren Moore and Joyce Carol Oates. Inspired by Salvador DalÃ­Âs ÂThe Pharmacist of Ampurdan Seeking Absolutely Nothing,Â Moore summons the inner life of Alan Bowling, a pharmacist with a dark secret who goes for long walks on the outskirts of town; the ending feels less like a gotcha moment and more like a fitting, quiet conclusion. In ÂLes Beaux Jours,Â Oates plunges headfirst into the rumors of pedophilia that haunt BalthusÂs work, writing as the scared prepubescent subject of the title painting whoÂs trapped in the artistÂs shadow world. Suspended between reality and fantasy, her story functions as a kind of parable about the seductions of art, or, as Oates writes, Âsomething she could not have defined Â the consolation of art, the impersonality of art, the escape of art.Â

Both Moore and Oates find drama in psychological complexity. Their stories, the best in the book, move beyond mere use or homage to something approaching understanding. Rather than simply refer back to their chosen paintings, they seem to inhabit them.

WASHINGTON Â With the unveiling here Monday at the National Portrait Gallery of the official presidential likenesses of Barack Obama and the former first lady, Michelle Obama, this city of myriad monuments gets a couple of new ones, each radiating, in its different way, gravitas (his) and glam (hers).

Ordinarily, the event would pass barely noticed in the worlds of politics and art. Yes, the Portrait Gallery, part of the Smithsonian Institution, owns the only readily accessible complete collection of presidential likenesses. But recently commissioned additions to the collection have been so undistinguished that the tradition of installing a new portrait after a leader has left office is now little more than ceremonial routine.

The present debut is strikingly different. Not only are the Obamas the first African-American presidential couple to be enshrined in the collection. The painters theyÂve picked to portray them Â Kehinde Wiley, for Mr. ObamaÂs portrait; Amy Sherald, for Mrs. Obama Â are African-American as well. Both artists have addressed the politics of race consistently in their past work, and both have done so in subtly savvy ways in these new commissions. Mr. Wiley depicts Mr. Obama not as a self-assured, standard-issue bureaucrat, but as an alert and troubled thinker. Ms. SheraldÂs image of Mrs. Obama overemphasizes an element of couturial spectacle, but also projects a rock-solid cool.

[Read our interview Kehinde Wiley | Read our interview with Amy Sherald]

It doesnÂt take #BlackLivesMatter consciousness to see the significance of this racial lineup within the national story as told by the Portrait Gallery. Some of the earliest presidents represented Â George Washington, Thomas Jefferson Â were slaveholders; Mrs. ObamaÂs great-great grandparents were slaves. And today weÂre seeing more and more evidence that the social gains of the civil rights, and Black Power, and Obama eras are, with a vengeance, being rolled back.

On several levels, then, the Obama portraits stand out in this institutional context, though given the tone of bland propriety that prevails in the museumÂs long-term ÂAmericaÂs PresidentsÂ display Â where Mr. ObamaÂs (though not Mrs. ObamaÂs) portrait hangs Â standing out is not all that hard to do.

The National Portrait Gallery collection isnÂt old. It was created by an Act of Congress in 1962 and opened to the public in 1968. (The Obama unveiling is billed as part of its 50th birthday celebrations.) By the time it began collecting, many chief executive portraits of note were already housed elsewhere. (The collection of first lady portraits is still incomplete; commissioning new ones started only in 2006.)

There are, for sure, outstanding things, one being Gilbert StuartÂs so-called ÂLansdowneÂ PortraitÂ of George Washington from 1796, a full-length likeness packed with executive paraphernalia: papers to be signed, multiple quill pens, a sword, and an Imperial Roman-style chair. Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.

[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]

Uninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President TrumpÂs populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.

This continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And thereÂs a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de KooningÂs 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.

Mr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.

In an imposingly scaled painting Â just over seven feet tall Â the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in StuartÂs Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. ObamaÂs predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. HeÂs still troubleshooting, still in the game.

His engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts Â and cosmetically corrects Â the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against Â really embedded him in Â a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his fatherÂs birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.

Mrs. ObamaÂs choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.

At the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but itÂs still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin Â a color with ambiguous racial associations Â and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.

She shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. ObamaÂs face forms the compositionÂs peak, but could be almost anyoneÂs face, like a modelÂs face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating Â hoping for Â a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.

And while IÂm wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. ObamaÂs portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. ObamaÂs will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions Â on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which thereÂs no set-aside place for it to land.

If first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women Â ladies or not Â should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.

WASHINGTON Â In a big partisan gerrymandering case that will come before the Supreme Court in March, lawyers and judges have already devoted thousands of words to the question of why some of MarylandÂs eight congressional districts are so, ah, creatively drawn.

But the best answer by far comes from the man who drew them.

In 2011, Eric Hawkins lugged a laptop loaded with demographic data and a program called Maptitude to Capitol Hill and the offices of the stateÂs six Democratic House members. Over a series of meetings of which there apparently are no written records, Mr. Hawkins not only crafted new districts for those members, but rerouted the district of 10-term Republican Representative Roscoe Bartlett to make it substantially more challenging for a Republican.

In the first election after the new maps were drawn, Mr. Bartlett failed to muster even 38 percent of the vote. And Maryland Democrats added another House seat to the six they already boasted.

Asked in a deposition last year why the stateÂs Democratic House members met with him, Mr. Hawkins was refreshingly forthcoming. ÂThey wanted to get re-elected,Â he said.

Mr. Hawkins, an analyst for a Washington political consulting firm called NCEC Services Inc., is part of a cottage industry of statisticians, computer jockeys and political sages whose business is to turn demographic data into electoral maps. His firm works exclusively with Democrats; others Â like Geographic Strategies, run by the former Republican Party redistricting expert Thomas B. Hofeller Â are dog-loyal to Republicans.

By and large, they are political junkies and data nerds. Mr. Hawkins left the University of Colorado in the 1980s to join the doomed presidential campaigns of Senator Gary Hart and Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts before going into consulting. Mr. Hofeller holds a Ph.D. in government, helped develop the first computerized redistricting system for CaliforniaÂs State Assembly, and has long been the mapmaking Ã©minence grise in the Republican Party.

In the current stew over partisan gerrymandering, few mapmakers are eager to talk about the back-room sausagemaking that occurs when state and congressional political boundaries are redrawn. Much of what they do say, like Mr. HawkinÂs concise reflection on politics, comes from court depositions. And understandably so: To their many detractors, redistricting consultants surface every 10 years, cicada-like, to ravage the landscape of minority parties in state legislatures and Congress. A 2012 magazine article named them ÂThe League of Dangerous Mapmakers.Â

But the reality is at least somewhat different. If most mapmakers are unabashedly partisan, their work goes well beyond back-room politics. A good map meets constitutional requirements, such as allotting an equal number of people to every district and respecting racial and ethnic populations. It keeps communities intact rather than splitting them into different jurisdictions; pays attention to rivers and other geographic features that shape jurisdictions. It doesnÂt needlessly oust incumbents.

And when one party controls the process, even good maps usually strengthen majority control. The Supreme Court has allowed that some partisanship in redistricting is inevitable; the question in the Maryland case is whether it has run unconstitutionally amok.

In the most egregious partisan gerrymanders, maps generally ignore some or all of those strictures. For their part, mapmakers are quick to point out that their job is to implement political will, not to determine it.

ÂThe person paying the bills drives it,Â said Keith Gaddie, a University of Oklahoma political scientist who advised RepublicansÂ 2011 redistricting of the Wisconsin State Assembly, which was challenged in the Supreme Court last fall. ÂYou can give them caution and counsel, but theyÂre going to do what theyÂre going to do.Â (Mr. Gaddie and a second scholar filed an amicus brief in the Wisconsin case urging the Supreme Court to rein in gerrymandering.)

Said one Republican consultant, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity: ÂSome people think I just walk into a legislature with a map and they genuflect to me. ThatÂs not the way it works.Â

Indeed, as court records in the Maryland case show, incumbent politicians often make demands of mapmakers that go beyond drawing themselves a safe seat. Representative C.A. ÂDutchÂ Ruppersberg, a Maryland Democrat who served at the time on the House Intelligence Committee, insisted that Fort Meade, the home of the National Security Agency, be part of his turf, according to a deposition of then-Governor Martin OÂMalley. Representative Donna Edwards, another Democrat who left office last year, insisted that her district be left untouched Â no easy task, as population shifts alone required that new boundaries be drawn.

Besides the Wisconsin and Maryland cases, partisan gerrymanders are under assault in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, where courts invalidated Republican-drawn congressional maps this month. Mr. HofellerÂs firm, Geographic Strategies, drew the North Carolina districts Â as in Maryland, according to court depositions, without leaving a paper trail. Pennsylvania relied on legislative staff members to carve up the stateÂs House districts.

But in all cases, the process is more or less the same. Mapmakers begin with Census Bureau data that marries political boundaries and geographic features like rivers and roads with information on residentsÂ ages, races and ethnicities. Redistricting software can add custom-tailored political data to the mix, allowing map-drafters to see instantly the partisan impact on a proposed district of adding or removing areas as small as a block.

Kimball W. Brace, whose firm, Election Data Services, mostly assists Democrats, said the basics are little changed from the 1980s, when he used huge paper maps and acetate overlays to create districts in Illinois. Back then, he said, finished map data was entered onto coding sheets by hand, then taken to a local bank whose mainframe would crunch the numbers overnight after it finished clearing checks.

Modern computers have reduced those weeks of work to hours, and both maps and census and political data have become far more accurate, he said. In creating 2011 redistricting maps, Wisconsin Republicans created a composite partisan score for each of the stateÂs 6,000-plus wards based on the results of statewide elections since 2004. North Carolina used results from as many as 20 state elections; MarylandÂs NCEC Services used a regularly updated ÂDemocratic performance index,Â a proprietary analysis of the partyÂs strength in state and federal races.

Redistricting that begins in 2021 is likely to be even more finely tuned, Mr. Brace said, relying on the explosion of marketing and online information that can infer personal preferences down to individual households. ÂWeÂre seeing that more and more in campaigns,Â he said, Âso I think youÂll see people wanting to use it in redistricting.Â

While consultants can and sometimes do produce hundreds of suggested maps, most present political leaders with between five and 10 options that can be fine-tuned to meet incumbentsÂ wishes.

In states where political power is divided, district maps may be politically neutral Â or drawn to shield incumbents in both parties. In other states under one-party control, the political marching orders may be more brazen: North Carolina Republicans ordered that no more than three of the stateÂs 13 House seats be given to Democrats.

Mr. Gaddie, who analyzed the partisan impact of proposed Wisconsin State Assembly maps for the chamberÂs Republicans, says partisan gerrymandering has become a threat to the political system because politics has devolved into all-out ideological war, not because of redistricting software or dark-hearted mapmakers. He said he abandoned a sideline as a redistricting adviser and expert witness in redistricting lawsuits after finishing work in Wisconsin.

ÂI liked working for them in Â02,Â he said, Âbecause IÂd sit down with a lawyer and theyÂd say, ÂI like competitive maps. When a map is competitive, we can win on the merits.Â By the time I get around to 2011, theyÂve changed. I canÂt defend this crap.Â

That is not to say that mapmakers are wholly innocent bystanders in the process. ÂIt would be good for the country and politics if partisan gerrymandering ended,Â Mark Gersh, the former president of NCEC Services, said in an email this week. But in a subsequent interview, Mr. Gersh stood up for his firmÂs work in Maryland and elsewhere.

ÂI donÂt believe in unilateralism,Â he said. ÂIf one side does it, the other has to. If that makes me unethical, so be it.Â

MarylandÂs redistricting was driven by the Democratic governor, Mr. OÂMalley, who testified in a deposition that he felt Âit was not only my responsibility, but my dutyÂ to saturate MarylandÂs Republican-leaning Sixth District with Democratic voters Âprovided we obeyed the dictates of the law.Â

They eventually flipped the Sixth District to Democrats, but only by redrawing other districts, domino-style, to ensure that the loss of Montgomery County voters did not endanger others in the delegation. In the resulting map, the Democratic Third District was so laughably contorted that a federal judge compared it to a Âbroken-winged pterodactyl, lying prostrate across the center of the state.Â

ÂIncumbent protection,Â Mr. Hawkins testified in the Maryland lawsuit last year, Âwas the major focus of this.Â

Asked whether those incumbents included Representative Bartlett, the Republican in the Sixth District, Mr. Hawkins replied, ÂNo.Â

The biggest political contests of 2017 were defined by their asymmetries: in funding, in ideology and, most viscerally, in strategy. On one side were those who saw everything as a battle and sought whatever advantage they could find. On the other were those devoted to what they thought were shared systems, norms and language, who spent most of the year increasingly beleaguered and struggling to find words.

The month before he lost his stateÂs special Senate election, the Alabama theocrat Roy Moore was accused by multiple women of extensive sexual misconduct. The day after The Washington Post published its initial article on the allegations, another woman reached out to the paper asking for a meeting. She had been a young teenager, she would claim, when Moore approached her; he got her pregnant, and she had an abortion at age 15. The allegations were stunning. But Post reporters quickly deduced that they were also false Â fabricated by an operative for Project Veritas, an organization led by the right-wing activist James OÂKeefe, in an effort to trick the paper into publishing false claims, thereby discrediting its earlier reporting. When the paper later detailed its interactions with the operative, its executive editor, Martin Baron, explained that any agreements she had made to remain off the record were invalid, entered into by a fraud acting in Âmaliciously bad faith.Â

To many, Âbad faithÂ is the phrase that seems to capture our entire moment, in all its mendacity and duplicitousness and engineered confusion. In December, when MSNBC dropped the contract of a contributor, Sam Seder, over a crude joke he made on Twitter in 2009, bad faith provided the most concise explanation. The joke was, by any credible reading, intended to mock people in Hollywood who continued to work with Roman Polanski after he pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. But another right-wing personality, Mike Cernovich, had excavated it and claimed, with disingenuous concern and abundantly clear ill will, that it meant the opposite, summoning a waiting, in-on-the-game audience to perform outrage and concern to MSNBCÂs parent company and sponsors. The phrase captured this familiar process: the willful misreading being wielded as a threat; the vexing figure pretending to care about something important in order to accomplish something vengeful or petty; the galling attempts to play dumb; the sneering claim that, well, I didnÂt make the rules. When a social-media countercampaign was mounted in SederÂs defense, it consisted largely of accusations and descriptions of Âbad faith.Â SederÂs contract was eventually reinstated.

This version of bad faith falls somewhere among a lawyerÂs claim of intentional dishonesty (This contract was entered into in bad faith), SartreÂs critique of inauthenticity (Do you even believe what youÂre saying?) and a broad, satisfying, barbed insult (You! Bad!). For liberals and centrists and dispossessed conservatives, it can feel like a way to reclaim power. To simply note the facts in a tone of disbelief Â say, that multiple government agencies were now being run by people who had recently considered those agencies illegitimate Â has gotten exhausting. ÂBad faithÂ goes beyond these symptoms to diagnose an underlying pathology.

It can be used to describe legislators who railed against the hasty passage of Obamacare (which was subjected to public and legislative debate and passed with concessions to its opponents) only to try to repeal it in utter secrecy, or who spent years warning about the budget deficit in apocalyptic terms only to vote for a tax bill that would increase it significantly. In polling in December, CNN and SSRS found only 27 percent of respondents agreeing that President Trump and the Republicans in Congress made Âa good-faith effort to cooperate with the minority partyÂ on their tax bill.

Strategic antagonism and manipulation find a natural medium on social platforms. A service like Twitter all but demands bad faith: ItÂs a place where fresh identities can be created and performed, often anonymously, and the stakes are only as high as the value you ascribe to not being banned. ItÂs a service where the official regulations are vague, self-serving and haphazardly enforced, and therefore maximally prone to exploitation. (To the extent that users have a social contract on Twitter, itÂs with Twitter, not with one another.) On social media, charges of Âbad faithÂ can address everything from automated spam to interpersonal conflict to the breakdown of political discourse.

The question is whether identifying bad faith can do anything to combat it. And the answer is: of course not. In theory, an accusation of bad faith derives its power from the presence of some persuadable audience Â some judge or observer or swing voter who recognizes strategic dishonesty and is repelled by it. But in our utterly polarized political reality, the idea of finding some unaligned, reasonable-minded mass to appeal to feels like an absurd fantasy. Instead, accusations of bad faith are laid directly at the feet of the bad-faith actors themselves, with one inevitable result: Now even the words Âbad faithÂ are used in bad faith. When the MSNBC host Chris Hayes, discussing Sam SederÂs brief firing, tweeted that Âthe entire culture and our politics are now dominated by people who have weaponized bad faith and shamelessness,Â one response came from Donald Trump Jr., who provided what felt like an algebraic proof of HayesÂs point. ÂI agree with this fully,Â he tweeted. ÂMain Stream Media has done exactly that for decades, but the people have finally caught on and arenÂt buying the BS anymore.Â

The sheer satisfaction offered by Âbad faithÂ is a sure sign of its impotence. ItÂs an invitation to dismiss powerful political actors as lost causes. But its speakers stubbornly refuse to admit that it also describes their own inability to force their enemies to play by the rules. The AtlanticÂs Megan Garber recently identified one major problem with the new use of Âbad faithÂ: As a description, it is Âboth conveniently expansive and conveniently specific.Â It is, despite its legal and philosophical trappings, most often deployed ad hominem, for the satisfaction of allies. ÂBad faith,Â Garber writes, Âis not concerned with individual claims of truth, or with individual lies, so much as it alleges someoneÂs dishonesty as an overarching condition.Â

It does not help that the people whom liberals are most eager to accuse of bad faith already have their own version of this claim. Among internet-native right wingers, the phrase Âvirtue signalingÂ has long done similar work, suggesting that the social-justice rhetoric of progressives is only a form of self-righteous, hypocritical point-scoring. This, too, was Âconveniently expansive and conveniently specific,Â but it also zeros in on a real human insecurity: the fear among many well-meaning and comparatively well-off liberals that their lifestyles and attitudes didnÂt measure up to their egalitarian ideals. The accusation is intentionally dismissive and nasty, but it at least has the potential to wound Â so long as the people being accused really do aspire, in good faith, to live up to their own values.

But if you really believe that your enemy is acting in bad faith, calling him or her out wonÂt get you far. Being accused of duplicitousness doesnÂt hurt if the duplicitousness is a conscious strategy. The charge will also have been anticipated. There is an entire genre of Trump apologetics, practiced by cable-news pundits and manifested on sites like Gateway Pundit and Infowars, based on justifying strategic disingenuousness: Any criticism of the administration is met with some combination of Âthe left did it firstÂ and Âwe have no choiceÂ and Âwhat about....Â

The bad-faith actor will claim, in other words, that his bad faith is both justified and necessary, that all possibility of good-faith engagement was exhausted long ago and it was not his fault. You may insist that your opponents respect your positions, your arguments, your facts. But it is a powerful manifestation of privilege to expect that they will see you as worthy of that respect. Shouting Âbad faithÂ can sound like shouting Âno fairÂ Â and revealing your previously undisturbed expectation that you will always be treated fairly.

So when bad faith does run into consequences, those consequences tend to be self-inflicted. After the Alabama election, Alex Marlow, editor in chief of Breitbart, admitted in a CNN interview that he thought at least one of the sexual-assault accusations against Roy Moore had Âa lot of credibilityÂ and made him uncomfortable. Moore, he said, was a Âweak candidate.Â But Marlow defended his siteÂs militantly pro-Moore coverage and its numerous attempts to discredit MooreÂs accusers. ÂI think they want to create a standard where President Trump, either from past or future accusations, will not be able to match whatever standard is now in place for who can be a United States senator,Â he said, referring to other media outlets. ÂI think thatÂs the playbook here. And I think itÂs part of the reason why it was so important for Breitbart to continue our coverage of the way we covered it.Â

In his account, this wasnÂt dissonance; it was strategy. He could justify this nihilistic tactic by reflexively claiming that other media did it first, leaving him no choice but to push back. This is a remarkable thing to announce openly, and it looks a lot like projection: If you justify your actions as the dictates of tactical Âplaybooks,Â you may assume that everyone else is doing the same. It illustrates the principal risk of acting in bad faith toward others, which is that somewhere along the line, you start to believe yourself.

When I first mentioned my idea of writing a memoir to David Carr, he told me that I needed to Âvisit a foreign land where writers live.Â

ÂThat bag of tricks of journalism Â anecdote, blah bidy blah, flick of the smarty pants here and there, juicy quote, more blah bidy blah, which you and I own and know, is no help here,Â The TimesÂs beloved media columnist emailed me weeks before he died.

Three years later when I sat down to write my first book Â a memoir about how covering Hillary ClintonÂs presidential campaigns consumed the formative years of my 20s and 30s Â I wished I could ask David what he meant by that foreign land. How did I get there?

IÂll never know exactly what he would have said, but I found my magic carpet in books.

IÂve always been a voracious reader. Growing up in San Antonio, I was the dork at the Friday night football games with my head buried in a book Â Jack Kerouac or Oscar Wilde, years before I really understood them. As my neighbors moved lava lamps and glass bongs and Foo Fighters posters into their college dorm rooms in Austin, I unpacked the BrontÃ« sisters boxed set and a vintage edition of ÂThe Bell Jar.Â Pretentious? LetÂs just say I didnÂt get invited to a lot of frat parties. But that was who I was.

Or at least that was who I thought I was until I became a political reporter. Suddenly, the only poetry I thought about came in the form of political speeches. The only symbolism came in schlocky campaign ads. ÂThe classicsÂ meant Richard Ben CramerÂs ÂWhat It Takes,Â David Foster WallaceÂs ÂUp, Simba!Â (plus glossary), Hunter S. ThompsonÂs ÂFear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail Â72Â and Timothy CrouseÂs ÂThe Boys on the Bus.Â I mixed in more obscure volumes, like ÂNixon Agonistes: The Crisis of the Self-Made Man,Â by Garry Wills, and every (credible) book about the Clintons (sorry, Ed Klein).

I read contrived memoirs by presidential candidates. For every ÂDreams From My Father,Â Barack ObamaÂs honest, literary portrayal of his biracial upbringing, there were a dozen cautious, formulaic vanity projects by politicians. They had names like ÂA Time for TruthÂ (Ted Cruz), ÂAmerican DreamsÂ (Marco Rubio), ÂOur Revolution: A Future to Believe InÂ (Bernie Sanders) and ÂHard ChoicesÂ (Hillary Clinton). Sitting alongside these titles on my bookshelf was the parody ÂSome New Beginnings,Â by Selina Meyer, the fictional fumbling vice president on HBOÂs ÂVeep.Â

But mostly, my reading diet consisted of Twitter and Politico. Buried in the crush of keeping up with the dayÂs news while on the campaign trail, I entirely lost the reader IÂd once been. I listened to audio books on the road, but it wasnÂt the same as curling up with a good book. And when I did have a layover at the airport or a couple of hours of downtime in a Hilton Garden Inn, I preferred to stare at my phone in a meditative state than read anything substantial.

So when I went on book leave last February and sat down to try to get newspaper writing out of my head and travel to this mythical place where writers lived, I considered part of the job reconnecting with my reading self. Book leave wouldnÂt just be about writing a book; it would also be about reading books. And not just reading for research purposes but trying to reconnect with my previous, ravenous, bookworm self.

For nine months, I would wake up early, sitting down in front of that terrifying blank page by 7 a.m., always fueled by an iced red eye. (Somewhere around Chapter 27, I found out I was pregnant and cut back to a single drip coffee Â worried our baby would come out addicted to La ColombeÂs cold brew with a shot of espresso.) IÂd write until 12:30 p.m. or 1 p.m. and then venture outside to get lunch. The afternoon was for reading, both the pages IÂd written and the pages that the real Writers, the ones who seemingly knew how to do this, had published.

Book leave may sound like a spa retreat in Arizona compared with a campaign bus in Ohio, but I had a hard time adjusting. IÂd gone from traveling the country with Mrs. Clinton surrounded by other reporters, campaign staff, voters Â all against the backdrop of ÂFight SongÂ Â to sitting in the same silent (except for the occasional sledgehammer from a neighborÂs renovation) spot at our dining room table by myself all day every day. IÂd been so driven by the instant gratification of a byline. Now I slaved away on something that quite possibly no one (except my mom) would read.

In those early weeks, I only allowed myself to read books that would help with my Âday jobÂ: cranking out the 100,000 words I was contractually obligated to deliver to HarperCollins by the fall. That meant mostly sticking to memoirs, studying the structure and voice that other Â real Â memoirists used. I read Richard FordÂs ÂBetween Them,Â a slim volume about his parents; ÂStop-TimeÂ by Frank Conroy; ÂDispatchesÂ by Michael Herr; all of Mary KarrÂs books (including rereading ÂThe LiarsÂ ClubÂ and ÂCherryÂ). I read Ms. KarrÂs essential guide, ÂThe Art of Memoir,Â and Stephen KingÂs ÂOn Writing.Â (Stephen, if youÂre reading this, please update your advice about not watching TV while book writing to the Twitter era, because you seem to spend a lot of time there.)

I devoured Nora EphronÂs ÂI Feel Bad About My NeckÂ while sitting at the salon feeling bad about my roots. I read Joan DidionÂs ÂSouth and WestÂ (even her rough notes were better than anything I could ever hope to write) and Sherman AlexieÂs ÂYou DonÂt Have to Say You Love Me,Â his gut-wrenching, lyrical, personal story about growing up on the Spokane Indian Reservation. That made me want to reread ÂThe Toughest Indian in the World.Â God, I love Sherman Alexie. Paul AusterÂs ÂThe Invention of SolitudeÂ took longer to get through. Cheryl Strayed broke my heart with ÂWildÂ and then lifted me back up off the floor with ÂTiny Beautiful Things.Â

Sometimes book reading and book writing would clash Â two parts of my brain in conflict on the page. After reading Dave EggersÂs ÂA Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Â I stupidly thought I too should type up self-indulgent, 5,000-word riffs about, say, finding an apartment in New York or taking surf lessons while on assignment with the Obamas in Hawaii, things that had little to do with the larger story. But it didnÂt take an editor to tell me that there was nothing staggering or genius about my attempts at Mr. EggersÂs stream of consciousness.

From there, I drifted into fiction, still studying voice and structure as I thought about how to craft my own book, ÂChasing Hillary: Ten Years, Two Presidential Campaigns, and One Intact Glass CeilingÂ (due out April 24, just in case you want to join my mom and pre-order). I became wrought with insecurity that these masters could do what I (the yeoman newspaper reporter) could never do. I wanted to retreat back to my usual Âflick of the smarty pantsÂ stories, accepting IÂd been too bathed in newsprint to ever emerge a Writer.

I read William StyronÂs ÂSophieÂs Choice,Â a story IÂd heard about for years but didnÂt really understand until I read it; ÂStay With Me,Â a beauty of a first novel by the Nigerian author Ayobami Adebayo; ÂAnnie JohnÂ by Jamaica Kincaid and Â right before a canoeing trip in West Texas Â James DickeyÂs ÂDeliverance.Â

My mind was blown by Junot DÃ­azÂs ÂThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.Â I know, I know, that book came out a decade ago and blew everybodyÂs minds. But I was most likely on a campaign bus in Iowa at the time and hadnÂt noticed.

The writing part never got easier, but books made my days less lonely. I spent mornings in my own head but the afternoons were for Yunior and Lola and Oscar and Sherman and Toph Â and just like that I was back in the football stands with Dean Moriarty and in my dorm room in Austin with Esther Greenwood.
