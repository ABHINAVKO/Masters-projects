LONG BRANCH, N.J.  Jared Kushners family company recently began construction on an oceanfront development in this Jersey Shore city, a project that has the strong backing of local officials, who agreed to support it with $20 million in bonds.

But unknown to Long Branch officials, the Kushners have been in talks to team up with another family-run company that has an even bigger presence in the White House: the Trump Organization.

The Kushners are in private discussions to have President Trumps company manage at least one hotel at the center of the development known as Pier Village, according to people briefed on the previously unreported talks. The Kushner Companies and the Trump Organization have signed a letter of intent, though no deal is final and the Kushners are not required to inform city officials.

The long-running talks blur the line between family, business and politics in ways that lack precedent: Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner, the presidents senior adviser and son-in-law, retain financial interests in their family businesses. The Trump Organizations outside ethics adviser has raised questions about a potential deal  one reason the two-year-long discussions have not been completed.

The talks are underway as the White House role of Mr. Kushner has become increasingly strained because of his business dealings. Mr. Kushner lost his top-secret security clearance last month, in part because of worries that foreign governments might try to gain influence by doing business with him.

While Mr. Kushner has sold some holdings in Kushner Companies, he has held on to a majority of his stake, including an ownership interest in the recent $283 million expansion of Pier Village. Mr. Trump has handed over management of his company to his two oldest sons, but the president continues to own it.

The concern is that the president might not want to do anything that would upset the Kushner family agreement to do business with his company, said Marilyn L. Glynn, who served as general counsel in the Office of Government Ethics during Republican and Democratic administrations, when told by The New York Times about the Trump-Kushner talks.

The White House declined to comment. Both companies on Friday confirmed their discussions about the hotel in Pier Village, while dismissing ethics concerns.

The plans under discussion in Long Branch have called for the Kushners to own the hotel and make payments to the Trump Organization to run it. The bonds issued by the city, part of a broader renewal effort, are not earmarked for the hotel, but they will support public infrastructure around Pier Village, and in turn help the hotel and nearby properties succeed.

Last year, in another previously unreported endeavor involving the two family businesses, the Trump Organization began managing a Kushner-owned hotel in Livingston, N.J., people briefed on the matter said. That property, the Westminster Hotel, is believed to be the only hotel that the Trumps manage but do not brand.

The behind-the-scenes activity signals a deepening of the Trump-Kushner business relationship, which until recently appeared to be limited to a single residential project in Jersey City. It also poses potential ethical headaches for the White House, Ms. Glynn and other legal experts say.

Deals between the two families, said Ms. Glynn, who also served as acting director of the ethics office for part of George W. Bushs presidency, do not inherently violate any ethics rule. But, weighing whether new financial entanglements posed more of a problem than existing family ones, she added, I think the financial concerns trump the familial ones, so to speak.

Walter M. Shaub Jr., who led the ethics office under President Barack Obama and is a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said: If a subordinate is your son-in-law, maybe you like them, but once you have entangled business interests, theyve got leverage over you. Blood is not thicker than money for a lot of people.

In a statement, the Kushner Companies said the Trumps have zero equity of any type in our properties or businesses. In Long Branch, the statement said, we are contemplating a third-party operator agreement with their hotel management division at market rate. Noting that it did not specialize in the hospitality industry, the company said it had a business obligation to seek the most capable resource.

In an interview, Eric Danziger, the head of Trump Hotels, disputed that teaming up with the Kushners might pose a conflict.

This is a straight-up business deal, he said. If there were something out of the ordinary about the deal, then I think that question is fair, he said, but we do market transactions that are reviewed and checked.

Mr. Danziger said that Bobby Burchfield, the Trump Organizations outside ethics adviser, had asked about the financing involved in a potential Long Branch deal with the Kushners. Mr. Burchfield, who scrutinizes how the Trump Organizations partners finance deals, among other things, often requires more information before approving a deal.

Whether or not the Trumps and Kushners reach a deal, Mr. Kushner stands to gain. He is expected to eventually own 20 percent of the hotel in Pier Village, according to documents obtained through a public records request. And he was personally involved in the project early in the presidential campaign. In documents provided to Long Branch, the Kushner Companies stated that Mr. Kushner is strictly a passive investor.

He also retains a stake in a Kushner residential tower in Jersey City that bears the Trump name.

In Livingston, Mr. Kushner has divested from the Westminster Hotel, a three-story property overlooking strip malls. While it is unusual for the Trumps to manage hotels that do not carry one of their brands, Mr. Danziger said he was discussing similar deals with other companies as a way to expand the business under the right circumstances.

An owner wants to know they can depend on and rely on the operator, and we have a lot of credibility as operators, he said.

The growing relationship between the families could be helpful to the Trumps, as the ethical restraints they voluntarily adopted after the election have proved to be a hindrance to new business. The Trump Organization, which agreed not to start any new foreign projects during the presidency, has yet to open a new hotel in the United States since Mr. Trump took office.

While Mr. Danziger said the pipeline of potential deals was still very active, the company has also shown some signs of scaling back: Since the election, the Trump name has been removed from properties in Manhattan, Toronto and Panama.

A pairing with the Kushners could bring other complications. If the Trumps manage a Kushner property that received foreign or domestic government funding, it could test the Constitutions emoluments clauses, which essentially prohibit the president from accepting certain gifts from foreign or domestic governments. Some legal experts argue that local bonds like the ones issued in Long Branch could brush against the domestic clause.

The Kushners, who co-own the development with Extell Development, a New York real estate firm, said they would not accept money from foreign governments.

The firm, however, has a history of seeking cash from investors with strong connections to foreign governments, including Anbang, an insurance company in China.

The Kushners also have a history of teaming up with Israeli investors, which is ethically thorny for Mr. Kushner, whose central responsibilities in the White House include handling Middle East policy. Extells bonds have traded on the Tel Aviv stock exchange.

The Kushners also used money from Chinese investors to finance the construction of Trump Bay Street, the residential tower in Jersey City. The Chinese money came through the so-called EB-5 program, which offers visas to foreigners in exchange for $500,000 investments in real estate projects. Federal prosecutors have been investigating the Kushner businesses use of the program, though the company has said it no longer pursues this type of funding and did nothing improper.

In addition, investigators working for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election, have asked questions about Mr. Kushners interactions with foreign businesspeople, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.

In Long Branch, the Kushners are moving ahead with building the hotel in Pier Village and may add more hotels in the area.

The talks with the Trumps have focused largely on the Pier Village property under construction, which might carry the Scion brand, a new line of four-star hotels the Trumps announced in 2016. The Kushner Companies, however, said on Friday that it planned only to have the Trumps manage the hotel.

The hotel construction is part of the latest phase of a decades-long effort to remake the Long Branch waterfront after a fire destroyed the boardwalk in 1987 and contributed to a downward spiral.

Mayor Adam Schneider and local business leaders spearheaded a redevelopment plan in the 1990s that gave rise to Pier Village. The effort increased the citys annual beachfront revenue from $200,000 in the early 1990s to more than $2 million in 2017, the mayor said.

The Kushners have long owned an oceanfront house in an exclusive section of town, and in 2014, they teamed up with Extell to buy Pier Village.

With the purchase, the Kushners took over the part of Pier Village that already had a row of restaurants and shops, as well as a vacant strip of land that will eventually feature luxury residential condominiums, retail stores and the hotel.

Mr. Kushner was involved in planning the project. He was copied on emails with city officials, and the mayor recalls meeting with him twice.

Mr. Kushner assumed a role in the White House, but his sister, Nicole Meyer, and his father, Charles Kushner, continued to work on the effort, including discussions with officials about the bonds.

In September, the City Council unanimously approved the bonds to help close a funding gap. The city will borrow the money to reimburse Kushner Companies and Extell for approved costs that arise from building public improvements such as a boardwalk, public restrooms and a childrens play area.

Mr. Schneider said that the arrangement would not cause a tax increase, and that the city had struck a better deal with the Kushners and Extell than with the previous owners of Pier Village.

The city expects to more than recoup its investment by collecting an annual service charge and other payments that the Kushners and Extell pay in lieu of certain taxes. And the city said it had obtained a personal guarantee from Charles Kushner.

Its actually a very lucrative deal to municipalities, Mr. Schneider said.

A week after the city approved the bonds, emails show, Ms. Meyer invited local officials to lunch at the Beach House restaurant at Pier Village. Please let us know if you would like to join, the invitation said, and thank you for all your support and efforts!

When informed by reporters that the Trump Organization might ultimately be involved in a hotel in his town, Mr. Schneider, a Democrat first elected in 1990, sighed and expressed concern.

But he added: Our success is that we have a hotel thats doing a great volume of business thats creating jobs and economic vitality. It can be achieved no matter what name is on any building.

Adam Rippon became a for-real famous person in America in under a month. The 28-year-old figure skater arrived home from the Winter Olympics with a bronze medal in the figure skating team event, went on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, had photo shoots with magazines including InStyle and Rolling Stone, went to the Oscars in an S-and-M-themed tuxedo that got rave reviews, and then came to New York City for stops at Vanity Fair and BuzzFeed and Bravo. 

Next, hes off to tour with Stars on Ice, but then what? This week, he came to The New York Times, where a group of reporters and editors grilled him about what hes learned and where hes going.

The Times: How do you go through all this and stick to who you are, which is really a figure skater? How are you going to find the time to practice?

ADAM RIPPON: Well, I think the thing is that who I am isnt defined by just being a skater. I think at the very core I am somebody who loves engaging with people, I love making people laugh, and along the way Ive been a professional athlete and someone whos gone to the Olympics.

How are you going to find time to continue to skate at the level that youve been skating at?

This was my first and probably  not probably. Im not going to lead you down that path. This is my first and last Olympic experience as an athlete. On our Olympic team I was 28 years old, and we had two other really talented kids who were 17 and 18. So theres a bit of an age gap there where I could have changed their diapers and babysat them when they were born. Im an Olympic medalist, Im a former national champion  I think now is my time to kind of step back and help them.

Are you saying you dont want to skate competitively any more?

I dont know. I know I wont make it to another Olympic Games. And I think right now, being one week out of the Olympics, its probably too early to be like, Its over! Tie em up, put em on the shelf! Its something Ive been trying to do my entire life. Now everything I do is literally just bonus.

How has that affected how brands and sponsors approach you? So much of sponsorships is tied to medaling, and specific championship goals.

Im not your typical Olympic athlete by any means. The response Ive gotten in the interactions I have with people is that me being an athlete is so secondary, which I feel very comfortable with. I can take all of those tools with me and select whatever is out there next. But I think that, you know, Ive done a lot as an athlete. So I dont want to take anything away from that. But at the same time I dont think thats why Im here today in this room. There are other athletes who are more decorated or more accomplished, but theyre not as funny and theyre not as cute.

Did you feel that during the games? Because I feel like, just from someone who wasnt in Korea, the narrative minimized your skating.

Yes. I knew that I was opening my big mouth and saying a lot of stuff. I, at some level, knew that I would get a lot of attention  its not typical that athletes go and they speak their mind or they joke around with the media whos there. I think the narrative around me, yes, a little bit downplayed that I was even an athlete.

But at that time I was sort of having fun with it, because there started being more and more attention and then all of a sudden it was like, I bet by the end of this people will start calling me Americas sweetheart. I really wanted to push the narrative that you can just be yourself, and there will be people who dont like you  but theyre stupid.

You also walked right into U.S. politics and gay politics when you went there. Was that a deliberate decision on your part in advance?

I know a lot of people think, You know, you dont need to make everything political. But if you have somebody whos the representative of the country or a representative of all of the athletes there and theyre on record stating that they think that gay marriage could be the societal collapse of America? As a gay person, representing the United States at the highest level of sport, yeah, I have a problem with that. I dont feel like thats representative of me.

The world is watching. Its your chance to speak up for those people who really dont feel like they have a voice. I was asked a question and I just answered it really honestly and you know, Im a 28-year-old taxpaying voting man. As a fully grown adult, its important for me to voice my concerns.

Have you had a lot of pushback on social media?

Yes, I mean, theres not a day that goes by that I dont have maybe a few hundred messages that say, stay in your lane. You should give back your Olympic medal. Or like, You didnt even win.

Do you engage with them?

I only engage with the ones who are just incredibly stupid. Because you cant engage with somebody whos just trying to be nasty, theyll just continue to be nasty.

Can you speak at all to the experience of being out in a sport that has for so long been associated with being culturally gay?

In skating, I think its taboo to be gay. I know when I was younger I tried to be everything but gay. Everyone calls you gay when youre young: Oh you skate, youre gay. Youre like, No Im not! But inside youre like, yes you are, youre very gay.

How do you try to go against it?

For me what was hard was I would have girlfriends and I was like, this isnt gross. So it was hard for me to kind of find a balance of am I gay or does everybody feel like this? I tried so hard to just not be that and not just be another cliché. You know, on the Olympic team, of all the skaters on it, I was the only one that was gay. Are there gay people in skating? Hell yeah there are.

Do you have any permanent physical repercussions from skating?

No, just emotional. Yes, of course theres a few. I wake up every morning and twist my ankles and it sounds like a music box  clack clack clack clack clack.

You talked about eating issues and body image issues contributing to injuries  youre in a position now, especially during the Games, when theres so much scrutiny on your body, and youve got a lot of thirst coming your way. Im wondering how you deal with all that scrutiny?

Breaking my foot was sort of the best thing that ever happened, because I went to the Olympic Training Center and I sat down with a nutritionist and I told her, I know Im a mess and I know that Im doing something wrong. Now Im comfortable in my own skin. And it wasnt always that way. But you know, I like my body. Even though I havent been to the gym in two weeks and I had a few trips to McDonalds when I was at the Olympic Village.

But you know, Im an athlete, I work really hard for the body I have and yes, there are always going to be people who are like, Oh youre too skinny or youre too heavy or your boobs look weird or whatever. This is the body that you have. Embrace it. Its so easy to be a commentator in anybodys life because everybody has a platform now. Everybody has a Twitter. Everybody has an Instagram so its so easy to just say, Youre fat.

People arent saying youre fat.

No. Well. Because Im not fat right now. Not yet. So I think that whats important is that when you have body goals that you speak to somebody whos a professional. And that they tell you, This is realistic.

It sounds like youre good at shaking off negativity and trolls. Do you see younger people struggling with that on social media?

My advice to the young kids coming up is that there is way more positivity coming your way. Before you respond to a negative tweet or somebody whos just trying to be hateful, respond to five positive messages first. Once you are finished responding to those five, you realize that the one negative is just so not important, and youve already lost interest in trying to be like, You dont know me! Its just not important. They dont know you, and they obviously dont want to get to know you.

Have you heard from athletes that are in the closet?

I heard from a few athletes actually when I was in Korea, and they asked me about my experience. I think everyones circumstance is a bit different. For me I found that I was a lot more confident in who I was after I came out publicly. When I was coming out, I read a lot about other peoples coming-out stories. I really felt like they made it so normal and it wasnt a big deal and that their life still went on.

When was this?

This was about 2014. It was around the time of the Sochi Olympics. I said, you know what, I want to be taken seriously and I dont want to come out as gay when Im skating terribly. You know theyre like, Oh, that was the kiss of death! So I worked really hard, because I felt like it was important  it gave my skating a greater purpose because it was not for me. And then I felt so liberated once I did it, because I was able to make music decisions, costume choices that I wanted to make.

In skating you have four minutes to show the world what youve been working on your entire life. If you cant embrace who you are, how are you going to show a panel of judges or the world who you are in four minutes? Im just going to be me who loves trashy music and wants to skate in something thats kind of slutty. And just really have a good time throughout the whole competitive experience, because if youre not enjoying it, its already a rough situation to be in. But if youre trying to be something else while going through something so pressure filled, theres almost no joy in the whole experience.

What kind of advertisers have been reaching out to you for endorsements? Were there surprises?

Theyve all gone to my management team and Ill have a meeting with them when I get back. I think theyre trying to not preoccupy me too much or throw me off. Ive been really surprised with the response Ive gotten from so many people and all of the opportunities that I have coming up. I hope Ill stick around for a while. I feel like in maybe a year or two, people will be like, Adam Rippon is so funny. And did you know that he went to the Olympics? And I kind of have a feeling that Ive used the Olympics to get myself to meet the world.

Is the Olympic athletes village really like a hotbed of sexual Tinder, Grindr, everything?

Heres the thing. The condoms arent special. The reason that they go through so many is because people like me take maybe 400 of them and I have little gift bags for my friends. Theyre just like Korean  it says latex condom, but in Korean. But you know what, when youre in a high-pressure situation and theres like beautiful people all around, yeah, emotions get going.

But as somebody whos 28, Im not about to find somebody, try to sneak around five different roommates, lock a door and go through all of that. Ill let young kids have this sexual camp experience here at the Olympics. Ill just sit back, Ill wait, and Ill figure it out when I get home.
