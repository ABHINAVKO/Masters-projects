Thomas Luken, a political force in Ohio for more than 30 years as a federal prosecutor, a member of Congress and the mayor of Cincinnati, died on Wednesday in Cincinnati. He was 92.

His son Charlie said the cause was AlzheimerÂs disease.

Charlie Luken was the third member of his family elected mayor of Cincinnati, following his father and his uncle Jim.

Thomas Luken was known as much for his temperamental, confrontational style as he was for leading, as mayor, the cityÂs purchase of a private bus company in the early 1970s to avoid higher fares.

ÂHe was after the New Deal, but that was his brand of politics,Â Charlie Luken said in an interview. ÂAnd he liked to fight and he liked to argue.Â

One of the many Cincinnati Democrats he mentored was Jerry Springer, who would find fame as the host of a raucous nationally syndicated talk show. Mr. Springer was a member of the  City Council and later the mayor, from 1977 to 1978.

ÂHe was tough, he was rough,Â Mr. Springer said of Mr. Luken to WCPO-TV in Cincinnati. ÂHe wasnÂt necessarily the most genial guy.Â

But as the current mayor, John Cranley, said at a news conference on Wednesday after the death, Mr. Luken was an influential, popular ally.

ÂHe marched in Selma, put together the coalition to create the first Democratic majority in the City Council and passed an investment in public transportation that nobody has done since,Â Mr. Cranley said.

He added: ÂI went to church festivals with Tom Luken when I was running the first time. Of course, nobody knew who I was, but they knew who he was.Â

At another church festival, Mr. Luken followed Steve Chabot, his Republican opponent in a congressional election, as he handed out plastic cups with his name on them. Howard Wilkinson, a political reporter for WVXU Radio in Cincinnati, recalled on the station on Thursday that Mr. Luken had then promised potential voters: ÂIf you come up to me with a Chabot for Congress cup, IÂll fill it with beer.Â

ÂThat won him a lot of votes,Â Mr. Wilkinson said.

Thomas Andrew Luken was born in Cincinnati on July 9, 1925. His father, Walter, was a factory worker; his mother, the former Minnie Kisbert, was a homemaker. After graduating from Xavier University and the Salmon P. Chase Law School, both in Cincinnati, he served in the Marines. (The law school later moved across the Ohio River to become part of Northern Kentucky University.)

He was elected city solicitor of Deer Park, a suburb of Cincinnati, before being named first assistant United States attorney for the Southern District of Ohio. That appointment was helped by his brother Jim, a labor leader whose friendship with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy was based in part on their dislike of the Teamsters union president, Jimmy Hoffa. Jim Luken pulled his milk deliverers union out of the Teamsters in 1961.

After serving on the City Council, which included a year as mayor, from 1971 to 1972 Â at the time, the council elected the mayor Â Mr. Luken won a special election to fill a vacant seat in Congress in 1974. The vote came amid a backlash against Republicans in the wake of the Watergate scandal.

He lost an election for a full term later that year but returned to Congress when he moved to another district in 1976. He was re-elected six times.

Mr. Luken found a major issue in the late 1980s: the power of tobacco companies.

ÂHe had lost three siblings to lung cancer,Â Charlie Luken said, Âand he took on Big Tobacco full throttle.Â

Mr. Luken introduced legislation that would have prohibited the sale of cigarettes in vending machines, stiffened warnings about the health risks of cigarettes and required that tobacco be regulated as a toxic substance by the Environmental Protection Agency.

ÂI would love to legislate tobacco out of existence and make it criminal,Â Mr. Luken told The Cincinnati Enquirer in 1990.

He retired from Congress in early 1991 but returned to the Cincinnati City Council in 1993 to serve another term.

While there, he sponsored a law to remove tobacco advertisements from city bus shelters and buses and ban all outdoor advertising of tobacco products. His goal, he said, was to keep young people from starting to smoke. He told The Associated Press that advertising revenue from tobacco products was Âblood money.Â

ÂI donÂt think the city wants blood money,Â he said.

In addition to his son Charlie, Mr. Luken is survived by his wife, the former Shirley Ast; four daughters, Elizabeth Luken, Mary Miller, Margaret Sandman and Martha Mocahbee; two other sons, Timothy and Matthew; 15 grandchildren; and 16 great-grandchildren. Another daughter, Anne Hall, died in 2011.

In retirement from public office, Mr. Luken became an activist against the death penalty. He joined demonstrators in Lucasville, Ohio, in 2002 to protest an execution by lethal injection at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility.

ÂI think there is a real irony in that crime-scene tape there,Â he told The Enquirer in 2004, referring to a cordon outside the prison. ÂA crime occurred there. The state sanctioned murder.Â

Mayor Bill de Blasio will use the first State of the City address of his second term to announce a plan to change the City Charter as a way to improve the cityÂs campaign finance system.

Mr. de Blasio, who was plagued during his first term by ethical questions over his political fund-raising and the favors he did for deep-pocketed donors, will announce his plan on Tuesday night in his annual address, according to his press secretary, Eric F. Phillips.

The mayor will direct the commission Â whose members he will appoint Â to lower the limits for allowable campaign contributions to political candidates significantly, Mr. Phillips said. Donors currently can give candidates for citywide office no more than $4,950 during a four-year election cycle, while they can give a City Council candidate a maximum of $2,750.

ÂWe need a charter revision commission, we need to go at the specific idea that one of the things that most discourages people is money in politics,Â Mr. de Blasio said on Monday night on NY1. ÂPeople want to get money out of the political process as much as possible.Â

The mayor is also expected to propose a more generous model for public financing of elections, Mr. Phillips said. He said the commission will also be directed to consider possible reforms to the cityÂs Board of Elections and to find ways to promote greater voter participation.

One area that he will not instruct it to examine will be the issue of outside nonprofit groups created to take donations to support an elected officialÂs policies, like the Campaign for One New York, which was created for Mr. de Blasio, and whose efforts were later examined by state and federal investigators. Mr. Phillips said it was not necessary because the city had already passed a law limiting donations to such groups.

The path to election reform is somewhat muddled; most rules governing contribution limits and the matching funds program that provides public money to candidates are derived from legislation passed by the City Council. In addition, the Board of Elections is governed by state law, and it was not clear how it might be altered through changes to the City Charter.

Voters would have to decide on any proposals from the commission in a referendum. Mr. de BlasioÂs commission will seek to complete its work in time for voters to consider them in November, Mr. Phillips said.

In calling for a charter revision, Mr. de Blasio is using a tactic beloved by his two most recent predecessors, Michael R. Bloomberg and Rudolph W. Giuliani, who convened charter revision commissions on some six different occasions. Those commissions were often criticized as being too closely controlled by the mayor and too narrowly focused Â sometimes with the goal of pushing pet projects or political initiatives or seeking policy changes that would have been more appropriately handled as legislation by the City Council.

Before that, a highly respected charter revision commission was created by Mayor Edward I. Koch and passed by voters in 1989. It led to far-reaching changes in the way city government is organized.

Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr., the chairman of the 1989 commission, said that he was briefed on the mayorÂs proposal by a City Hall aide on Monday and approved of the focus on voting and campaign finance changes. ÂI think itÂs an extremely good idea,Â Mr. Schwarz said.

He said that the key to a successful revision was whether the commission is independent of the mayor. ÂItÂs a good way to say, ÂHere are subjects IÂd like you to look at,ÂÂ Mr. Schwarz said. ÂItÂs a bad way to say, ÂHere is what you have to do.ÂÂ

A spokeswoman for City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, who has vowed to lead a more independent Council, noted that the Council is considering its own legislation to convene a charter review commission.

That charter revision legislation would create a different sort of commission, whose members would be appointed by the Council, the mayor and other elected officials.

ÂWeÂre a little upset because we would like to make sure that itÂs a real charter revision and not something you get called five minutes before the appointments are made,Â said Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president who worked with the public advocate, Letitia James, to have the legislation introduced.

She said that she would like to see consideration of changes that give the City Council more control over the way money is budgeted and spent by city agencies, among other reforms.

ÂThe issue is, a charter revision commission should be independent, it should be a wide base of appointments from different entities of city government,Â Ms. Brewer said.

Mr. de Blasio will announce other programs on Tuesday to encourage voting and other types of civic engagement. Those include an effort to encourage people to participate in the 2020 federal census and a program, to be led by a newly created chief democracy officer, to get more people to register to vote. He will expand a program to encourage 17-year-olds to register to vote and he will provide money to enhance computer security at the Board of Elections.

On Monday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo proposed adding money to the state budget to provide for a statewide early voting system, in which some polling stations would be open during the 12 days before an election.

GROWING UP WITH THE IMPRESSIONISTS The Diary of Julie Manet Translated and edited by Jane Roberts Illustrated. 231 pp. I. B. Tauris. Paper, $24.50.

ÂI never buy a hat without wondering if Monsieur Renoir will like it,Â Julie Manet charmingly notes in a journal entry from 1898. The daughter of the French Impressionist painter Berthe Morisot and EugÃ¨ne Manet (the painter ÃdouardÂs younger brother), Julie is orphaned at 16. From then on, her well-being and Âsomewhat haphazard educationÂ are overseen by her guardian, the poet StÃ©phane MallarmÃ©, and by her motherÂs friends and colleagues, the Impressionists. The girl keeps company with the likes of Monet, Degas and Renoir, who, Julie reports, Âwas painting alongside CÃ©zanneÂ when he Âheard the news of MamanÂs death. He closed his paintbox and took the next train to Paris. I have never forgotten the way he arrived Â and held me close to him; I can still see his white cravat with its little red polka dots.Â

As here, JulieÂs most vivid sentences are visual, her pages enlivened with brief descriptions of landscapes and anecdotes from her daily life among the artists Â as when they gather to hang her motherÂs memorial exhibition in 1896 and a shouting match erupts between Degas and Monet. Julie becomes a painter herself, although, according to her translator, the art historian Jane Roberts, her work Âremains very derivative. She just couldnÂt get away from RenoirÂs influenceÂ and her Âoverwhelming admiration for her mother always cramped her style.Â Nor is she a writer. ThereÂs little depth here and no dramatic arc to take us from one day to the next. Which neednÂt be a problem: ÂThe Autobiography of Alice B. ToklasÂ is little more than a string of anecdotes about another group of artists in another era. But the voice is Gertrude SteinÂs and it delights. JulieÂs voice is unremarkable, that of a jeune fille from a certain turn-of-the-century milieu Â cultured, prosperous, right-wing, devoutly Roman Catholic Â who is lucky enough to be acquainted with a group of remarkable painters and poets, from whom weÂd like to hear much more than we do.

Except, unfortunately, during the diaryÂs last third, where she faithfully records Â and concurs with Â RenoirÂs relentless anti-Semitism (shared, alas, by the great Degas): ÂToday I was at RenoirÂs studio, where the talk is all about the Dreyfus Affair and against the Jews. ÂThey come to France to earn money, but if there is any fighting to be done they hide behind a tree,Â said Monsieur Renoir. ÂThere are a lot of them in the army, because the Jew likes to walk about wearing flashy uniforms. If they keep getting thrown out of all countries, there must be a good reason for it and they shouldnÂt be allowed as much room hereÂ. ItÂs unsinkable, the Jewish race. PissarroÂs wife isnÂt one, yet all the children are, even more so than their father.Â Â And so on and so forth.

Given the injustice perpetrated against Captain Dreyfus and, 40 years later, the unspeakable policies of Vichy France, which occurred during JulieÂs lifetime (she was born in 1878 and died in 1966), how are we to give such racism a pass? What to think Â what to do Â about great artists whose politics are repugnant?

For the moment (especially this moment), eschew Julie ManetÂs diary. If youÂre looking for a fully realized daughterÂs-eye view of growing up among painters, writers and composers, steeped in their impassioned practice and irrepressible talk of art, turn instead to ÂNight Studio,Â the wonderful memoir by Philip GustonÂs daughter, Musa Mayer.

WASHINGTON Â It started as a scrappy grass-roots protest movement against President Trump, but now the so-called resistance is attracting six- and seven-figure checks from major liberal donors, posing an insurgent challenge to some of the leftÂs most venerable institutions Â and the Democratic Party itself.

The jockeying between groups, donors and operatives for cash and turf is occurring mostly behind the scenes. But it has grown acrimonious at times, with upstarts complaining they are being boxed out by a liberal establishment that they say enables the sort of Democratic timidity that paved the way for the Trump presidency.

The tug of war Â more than the lingering squabbles between supporters of Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont Â foreshadows a once-in-a-generation reorganization of the American left that could dictate the tactics and ideology of the Democratic Party for years to come. If the newcomers prevail, they could pull the party further to the left, leading it to embrace policy positions like those advocated by Mr. Sanders, including single-payer health care and free tuition at public colleges.

The upending of the left comes amid a broader realignment in American politics, with the Republican Party establishment also contending with a rising rebellion, driven by pro-Trump populists. Just as the new forces on the right are threatening primary challenges to establishment Republicans, some groups on the left have begun talking about targeting Democratic incumbents in the 2018 midterm elections.

Entrenched Democratic groups are facing growing questions about the return on the hundreds of millions of dollars they have spent over the years. Groups affiliated with Mrs. Clinton Âspent so much money based on a bad strategy in this last cycle that they should step aside and let others lead in this moment,Â said Quentin James, a founder of a political committee called the Collective PAC that supports African-American candidates.

Mr. JamesÂs committee is among more than three dozen outfits that have started or reconfigured themselves since the election to try to harness the surge in anti-Trump activism. In addition to political committees, grass-roots mobilization nonprofits and legal watchdog groups, there are for-profit companies providing technological help to the new groups Â essentially forming a new liberal ecosystem outside the confines of the Democratic Party.

While the new groups gained early traction mostly on the strength of grass-roots volunteers and small donations Â and with relatively meager overall budgets Â they are beginning to attract attention from the leftÂs most generous benefactors.

ÂWeÂre in a disruptive period, and when we get through it, the progressive infrastructure landscape may look different,Â said Gara LaMarche, president of the Democracy Alliance, a club of wealthy liberals who donate at least $200,000 a year to recommended groups. ÂThere may be groups that have been around that donÂt rise to the challenge, and there may be some new groups that do rise to the challenge, while others fade away.Â

The Democracy Alliance has helped shape the institutional left, steering more than $600 million since its inception in 2005 to a portfolio of carefully selected groups, including pillars of the Clinton-aligned establishment like the think tank Center for American Progress and the media watchdog Media Matters.

But this year, the Democracy Alliance hired Archana Sahgal, a former Obama White House official, to help the new anti-Trump groups, and it suspended its intensive vetting and approval process to recommend donations to a host of groups created since last fallÂs election.

The Democracy Alliance distributed a Âresistance mapÂ to its donors in July including new groups focused on converting the anti-Trump energy into electoral wins, such as Flippable, Swing Left and Sister District, as well as legal watchdog groups and others focused on mobilizing protesters, such as WomenÂs March and Indivisible.

Perhaps no group epitomizes the differences between the legacy left and the grass-roots resistance like Indivisible. Started as a Google document detailing techniques for opposing the Republican agenda under Mr. Trump, the group now has a mostly Washington-based staff of about 40 people, with more than 6,000 volunteer chapters across the country. The national Indivisible hub, which consists of a pair of nonprofit groups, has raised nearly $6 million since its start, primarily through small-dollar donations made through its website.

Yet Indivisible has also received funding from the tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman, as well as foundations or coalitions tied to Democracy Alliance donors, including the San Francisco mortgage billionaire Herbert Sandler, the New York real estate heiress Patricia Bauman and the oil heiress Leah Hunt-Hendrix.

And an advocacy group funded by the billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros, a founding member of the Democracy Alliance and one of the most influential donors on the left, is considering a donation in the low six figures to Indivisible. Mr. Soros has already donated to a host of nonprofit groups playing key roles in the anti-Trump movement, including the Center for Community Change, Color of Change and Local Progress.

Indivisible would ÂgladlyÂ accept a check from Mr. Soros or his foundation, said an official with the group, Sarah Dohl. But, she added, the group is committed to ensuring that money from major donors does not become a majority of the groupÂs revenue Âbecause we want to maintain our independence both from the funders and from the party.Â

The group may start a political committee that could support primary challenges in 2018 against Democratic incumbents, Ms. Dohl said.

ÂItÂs not a secret that we would like to move the Democratic Party further left,Â she said, adding that Âthe party will only get to where it needs to go if it has groups like ours pushing them to do the right thing.Â She cited her groupÂs aggressive opposition to RepublicansÂ initial efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act at a time when she said Democratic congressional leaders ÂdidnÂt really have a strategy.Â

Established liberal groups like the Center for American Progress havenÂt always been as forceful, Ms. Dohl said, though she added that the think tank Âhas gotten better at calling on Democrats to stand up and speak more boldly than they have in the past.Â

The think tank, known as CAP, has engendered resentment from others on the left for casting itself as a leader of the anti-Trump movement and raising money off the resistance nomenclature. Within a few weeks of the election, CAPÂs sister organization, the Center for American Progress Action Fund, was offering T-shirts emblazoned with the word ÂResistÂ in exchange for donations of $40 or more. The campaign raised about $450,000 for ThinkProgress, the journalism arm of the action fund, which had its lawyers look into trademarking the iconography.

Daniella Leger, a CAP official, explained in a statement that the groupÂs legal team was merely exploring Âa standard questionÂ about whether to trademark the logo. ÂThe immediate response was no Â resistance belongs to everyone,Â she said.

But the embrace by CAP has some anti-Trump activists complaining privately that the group is anathema to the anti-establishment fervor animating the resistance, and it is siphoning away resources from the new groups.

The divisions have sometimes spilled into public view.

The leader of a group founded by Mr. Sanders called Our Revolution castigated the Democratic establishment as arrogant ÂdictatorsÂ who want to control the Âterms of unityÂ after her groupÂs activists were met by barricades outside the Washington headquarters of the Democratic National Committee when they visited in July to deliver petitions supporting a liberal policy platform.

And Ms. Hunt-Hendrix has urged progressive donors to boycott Democratic establishment-aligned groups like the centrist think tank Third Way and the nonprofits spearheaded by David Brock, the former conservative journalist who became a leading Clinton supporter and founded Media Matters and the opposition research outfit American Bridge.

Those groups represent a Âneoliberal wing of the Democratic PartyÂ that embraces Âbroken tacticsÂ and an ÂuninspiringÂ agenda Âmore focused on defeating the right than on creating an economy and society that lifts up all people,Â Ms. Hunt-Hendrix wrote in an op-ed article this year for Politico.

Matt Bennett, an official at Third Way, challenged predictions that the new wave of resistance activism would substantially shift the axis of the party. ÂThe idea that all the energy in the Democratic Party is on the far left is premature, and is going to turn out to be the worst prediction of the 2020 cycle,Â he said.

Mr. Brock and Ms. Leger both said that their groups have been providing research, polling, training and other resources to the new groups, which they cast as a boon to the left, rather than a threat to more established groups.

ÂThe resistance is strongest when everyone has access to our resources,Â Mr. Brock said. Ms. Leger said, ÂThese grass-roots groups play a different, unique role, and their energy is something the progressive movement hadnÂt seen in decades.Â And a D.N.C. spokeswoman, Xochitl Hinojosa, praised the new groups for their work to Âbring about progressive change and elect Democrats.Â

Yet one major Democratic donor, the Virginia real estate developer Albert J. Dwoskin, said the fluidity in the universe of liberal groups would cause some donors to sit on the sidelines Âto wait to see which ones have any legs whatsoever.Â And veteran Democratic operatives are concerned that the proliferation could further fracture the left, widening ideological divisions and leaving groups fighting for resources.

That doesnÂt bother Dmitri Mehlhorn, a political adviser to Mr. Hoffman, the billionaire founder of LinkedIn, who has brought a  venture capital approach to politics, seeding a wide array of new groups on the left.

ÂThe Democratic Party has been fractured,Â Mr. Mehlhorn said. ÂWe believe that by investing in different people and groups to try different techniques that good ideas will emerge.Â

Among Mr. HoffmanÂs donations are at least $1 million each to two of the groups suing Mr. TrumpÂs campaign, his administration, businesses and associates Â United to Protect Democracy, started this year by a former Obama White House lawyer, and Integrity First for America, which will be unveiled later this year by the pioneering New York trial lawyer Roberta A. Kaplan.

A Silicon Valley-like competition between start-ups might not be the best thing for the left right now, warned Rob Stein, a longtime Democratic strategist who helped create the Democracy Alliance to provide structure to the institutional left.

ÂHaving a thousand flowers blooming at the beginning of a new era is generally a good thing,Â Mr. Stein said. ÂBut when youÂve got your back against the wall, too many new blooms can cause message and operational cacophony.Â

He warned that the combination of ideological and structural divisions, along with a national party weakened by changes in campaign finance laws, could Âmake it very, very difficult for progressives and Democrats to drive a coherent message in 2018, and to align behind a single candidate in 2020.Â

Barack Obama is not the subject of ÂQuest,Â Jonathan OlshefskiÂs new documentary, an intimate and patient portrait of a North Philadelphia family. But the film, which begins and ends with presidential elections Â Mr. ObamaÂs in 2008 and his successorÂs eight years later Â is shadowed, in some ways haunted, by his presence and his temperament. At one point, he appears on television, in the wake of the massacre of school children and their teachers in Newtown, Conn. ÂThese neighborhoods are our neighborhoods,Â he says, referring to the places that have been devastated by gun violence. ÂThese children are our children.Â

The simple inclusiveness of that idea and the feeling behind it Â the sense that this nation, with all of its troubles, is something weÂre all in together Â may sound especially poignant now, and even a bit quaint. But a similar ethic of solidarity informs every moment of ÂQuest,Â which brings us into the neighborhood and the home of Christopher and ChristineÂa Rainey and their teenage daughter, PJ.

Christopher is also known as Quest, which is the name of the recording studio where he sits behind the mixing boards as local rappers spit their rhymes. ChristineÂa is Ma Quest, and the two of them, without vanity or any expectation of praise or reward, serve as mentors, confidants and semi-parental figures for the people around them. Mr. Rainey wakes up at dawn to deliver coupon circulars door to door. His wife works long hours at a shelter for survivors of domestic violence. If you lived in North Philly, you would want to know them. ÂQuestÂ offers the gift of imagining that you do, even as it honors their complicated, sometimes opaque individuality.

Mr. Olshefski doesnÂt pry too intrusively into their lives. He and his crew record only what the Raineys are willing to tell and show, and a story takes shape in response to events in their lives. Time flows like a current rather than advancing steadily according to the calendar or the clock. Mr. ObamaÂs first term passes in the blink of an eye. Before you know it, PJ and her father are talking about Mitt Romney as the 2012 election draws near.

Politics is part of their world, and some of the issues that have recently galvanized public debate Â health care, addiction, crime, tensions between the police and African-American citizens Â figure prominently in ÂQuest.Â Gun violence affects the Raineys with direct and traumatic force, disrupting the filmÂs calm, contemplative rhythm. (ThereÂs another, blessedly benign twist later on.) The disaster that strikes them is upsetting, and the stoicism with which they keep going is at least equally moving.

But the movie doesnÂt hold up its subjects as symbols of suffering or as emblems of strength. The Raineys themselves make no such claim: They take pride in the normalcy of their lives. When ChristineÂa hears Donald J. Trump making a pitch to Âthe African-AmericansÂ who he believes live in unrelieved squalor, she responds with disgust: ÂYou have no idea how we live.Â

Is it too much to hope that he watches ÂQuestÂ? Its power lies in its attention to the drama of everyday existence, and Mr. OlshefskiÂs sharp eye for character. We track PJÂs adolescent moods, the tenderness and occasional tension that defines her parentsÂ relationship, and also the ups and downs of other friends and kin. Ms. RaineyÂs older son, William, begins treatment for brain cancer as heÂs about to become a father. A talented rapper named Price, one of Mr. RaineyÂs creative collaborators and a drug user and alcoholic, squanders his promise and his friendÂs good will as he fights his habit.

The grace with which the family faces these hardships is the very definition of self-reliance. The hope that they might find some relief Â in the form of economic security, a more responsive government, more hours in the day Â is what makes ÂQuestÂ a deeply political film even as it is heartbreakingly clear about the limits of politics. Mr. ObamaÂs line about the common American destiny is echoed and complicated in another speech, during an anti-violence rally not far from the RaineysÂ home. Noting the absence of pop stars and politicians from the scene Â ÂWhereÂs BeyoncÃ© now?Â ÂWhereÂs Rihanna now?Â Â an activist insists that Âour first role models need to be us.Â I donÂt think IÂve ever heard a more succinct definition of what it means to be a citizen, and IÂve rarely seen a movie about citizenship as quietly eloquent as ÂQuest.Â

Cuba is like a giant Ping-Pong, caught in the cross hairs of United States foreign policy. One minute President Obama is relaxing restrictions, making it easier for tourists in the United States to visit the tiny island. Blink, and President Trump is rolling back some of the administrationÂs changes. Another blink, and the state department is advising Americans not to travel to Cuba after mysterious medical attacks on diplomats at the American Embassy in Havana.

With its politics in flux, Cuba may be more fascinating than ever for Americans already intrigued by its music, culture and art. The interest is evident from the number of Cuba-themed museum shows and exhibits around the United States, many of which have been held in tandem with Havana-based institutions.

Earlier this year, an exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History in New York was developed with members of the Cuban National Museum of Natural History, while another at the Bronx Museum was organized with curators from El Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, in Havana.

El Museo del Barrio in New York has a retrospective through Nov. 5 of Belkis AyÃ³n, the late Cuban visual artist who was first on view at the Fowler Museum in Los Angeles.

Olga Viso, executive director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, attributed some of the heightened interest to the Obama administration policies, which made travel to the island easier. Fidel CastroÂs death last November was also a factor for people who had boycotted the island during his regime.

ÂFor many years from the Â50s to late Â80s, Cuba was a cultural center in Latin America,Â said Iliana Cepero, professor of Latin American art and Cuban Culture at New York University and the New School. ÂThis relationship has been so tense for so many decades. Cubans have been waiting for this moment for all these years.Â

Both Ms. Viso and Ms. Cepero have curated Cuban-themed exhibitions. Ms. Viso was a developer of the WalkerÂs ÂAdiÃ³s Utopia: Dreams and Deceptions in Cuban Art Since 1950,Â which focuses on artists who remained in Cuba after the revolution, and opens on Nov. 11. Ms. Cepero created ÂCuba IsÂ at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles, which runs through March 4.

The images in that show capture rarely seen communities in Cuba, Âfrom the Cuban Â1 percentÂ Â the incredibly rich living in ritzy enclaves hidden away from the population Â and the underground world of the punk kids known as Âfrikis,Â Â Wallis Annenberg, the president, chairman, and chief executive of the Annenberg Foundation, said in an email. ÂWe aimed to capture Cuba at this critical moment, when the island nation is on the cusp of great change.Â

Ms. Annenberg commissioned Cuban photographers like RaÃºl CaÃ±ibano and Leysis Quesada Vera, and the political prisoner Geandy PavÃ³n, along with American photographers who have a history of shooting in Cuba, to Âshow us what Cuba is like today, outside of the retro cars and cigars that portray a romanticized version of the island in U.S. culture,Â she said. The show also features portraits of well-known Cuban performers like Celia Cruz and Gloria Estefan, fashion designers Narciso Rodriguez and Isabel Toledo, and the actor Andy Garcia.

One of the main goals of the show is to present Cuba in all of its contradictions, Âa very layered Cuba of today,Â said Ms. Cepero, who grew up in Cuba and left in 2006. She added that the island can be difficult to grasp, especially for tourists. On the one hand, it is filled with entrepreneurship, music and warm, vibrant people. On the other hand, racism, prostitution and political unrest are rampant, she said.

The real estate developer Jorge M. PÃ©rez donated over 170 works drawings, photographs, mixed-media and sculptures to the PÃ©rez Art Museum Miami (PAMM), one of the largest collections of contemporary Cuban art in an American museum.

For him, the three-part show, ÂOn the Horizon: Contemporary Cuban Art from the Jorge M. PÃ©rez Collection,Â is deeply personal. The Argentine-born son of Cuban parents, Mr. Perez grew up on the island as a child and fell in love with the art. ÂI donÂt think there is a country that per capita produces more great art than Cuba,Â he said. He attributes that to the Instituto Superior de Arte, the government-sponsored school for artists.

ÂThe education is rigorous, and only the best get selected to go there,Â he said. ÂThey produce just amazing artists Â thereÂs a continuation of this great artists that are coming from Cuba.Â

There are Cuba-themed exhibitions around the country. Here are some highlights:

1. On the Horizon: Contemporary Cuban Art from the Jorge M. PÃ©rez Collection

Through April 8, 2018, PÃ©rez Art Museum Miami

Presented in three ÂchaptersÂ over a year, the show is organized around the metaphor of the horizon line. It features work by Cuba-based artists as well as those living abroad; many have never been seen in a museum setting. Two chapters remain. ÂChapter 2: Abstracting HistoryÂ (through Jan. 7, 2018) takes a look at abstract geometries Â including linear horizon lines Â as they relate to both personal and historical narratives. ÂChapter 3: Domestic AnxietiesÂ (Jan. 18 to April 8, 2018) focuses on daily insecurities and personal stresses of the individual.

2. AdiÃ³s Utopia: Dreams and Deceptions in Cuban Art Since 1950

Nov. 11, 2017 to March 18, 2018, The Walker Art Center, Minneapolis

ÂAdiÃ³s UtopiaÂ focuses on artists who remained in Cuba after the Revolution. ÂIn Cuba, unlike Russian and the Soviet Union, there was no real formal policy on the role of artists within the revolution,Â said Olga Viso, executive director. ÂThat shifted in late Â60s and early Â70s when the Soviet Union stared to assert more influence on what policies were around free speech, communication and what was acceptable or not. Fidel issued this edict that art could be free as long as it operated within the revolution. That leaves it open to interpretation. Revolution means different things to different people.Â

3. CubaIs

Through March 4, 2018, Annenberg Space for Photography, Los Angeles

More than 120 images by Cuban and American photographers explore the often harsh realities facing Cubans in Cuba and in the diaspora. ÂThese are some of the aspects that are very much embedded in the Cuban reality of today,Â said the curator Iliana Cepero. ÂUsually our shows donÂt reveal these aspects. We wanted to be bold enough to talk about these issues because when you donÂt acknowledge them or discuss you donÂt solve them.Â

4. Hollywood in Havana: Five Decades of Cuban Posters Promoting U.S. Films

Through Jan. 7, Pasadena Museum of California Art, Pasadena

The 40 silk-screen posters promoting American films like ÂSinginÂ in the Rain,Â ÂCabaret,Â and ÂSilence of the LambsÂ were made between 1960 and 2009 as part of a revolutionary initiative to develop cultural awareness and dialogue. The show is part of the more than 70 exhibitions in ÂPacific Standard Time: LA/LAÂ held at various locations in Southern California.

5.ÂRafael Soriano: The Artist as MysticÂ 

Through Jan. 28, 2018, Frost Art Museum, Florida International University, Miami

This traveling exhibit features more than 90 paintings, pastels and drawings of the acclaimed painter Soriano, who emigrated to the United States after the Revolution. It begins with the ÂCuban geometric abstract styleÂ of his youth in the 1940s and Â50s, moves to his experimental phase in the 1960s and Â70s, and his period thereafter, when he realized he would never return to his homeland.

GANGNEUNG, South Korea Â In their first and second games together at the Olympic Games, the players on the unified Korean womenÂs ice hockey team suffered humiliating shutout losses against Switzerland and Sweden.

But for the only team to compete here with athletes from both North and South Korea, a 4-1 loss against Japan on Wednesday night was the most painful defeat.

In what has been an Olympics rife with geopolitical undertones, the game between Japan and Korea was the most political of all, pitting the unified Korean teamÂs players against rivals from the country of their former colonial occupiers.

ÂI would say the games against Japan, more than anything else, have been something that have brought the North and South Koreans together,Â said Randi Heesoo Griffin, who scored the only Korean goal. ÂWeÂve been saying we really need to win this game.Â

Symbolically, the showdown was much more than a meeting between teams ranked ninth and 22nd internationally. The colonial legacy lingers over any game played between Japanese and Korean teams. This one was played in an especially heated atmosphere: Before the Pyeongchang Olympics began, tensions between the Japanese and South Korean governments had been building over longstanding disputes about history and territory.

About a month before the opening ceremony, JapanÂs prime minister, Shinzo Abe, even hinted he might not attend the Games.

At the opening ceremony, most of the news media focused on the fact Vice President Mike Pence, who led the United States delegation, did not stand during an ovation for the unified Korean Olympic team as it marched into the stadium under one flag. But Mr. Abe did not stand, either.

And when an NBC commentator suggested during the opening ceremony that Âevery Korean will tell you that Japan is a cultural, technological and economic example that has been so important to their own transformation,Â the comment ignited so much anger in South Korea that NBC issued an apology and dropped the commentator from its coverage.

North KoreaÂs participation in the Games, including the presence of high-level emissaries including Kim Jong-unÂs sister, Kim Yo-jong, has fanned Japanese insecurity that the NorthÂs charm offensive will drive a wedge between the South, Japan and the United States.

The Korea versus Japan game was Âa physical representation of a concern that Japan and the United States have,Â said Jim Schoff, a senior fellow in the Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ÂÂWhat if we lose the South to the North in a battle of hearts and minds?ÂÂ

The volume in the stadium on Wednesday exceeded the first two games that Korea played at the Games, a pair of 8-0 losses, to Switzerland and Sweden.

Other than a small group of Japanese spectators who appeared to be mostly family members of that teamÂs players, the arena was dominated by Korean fans waving flags bearing a pale blue map of the unified peninsula. Together with the North Korean cheerleaders, who have become a familiar presence in the Kwandong Hockey Center over the past week, the spectators sustained their chanting throughout the game, shouting ÂBe strong!Â and ÂWe are one!Â on an endless loop of frenzied energy.

When Griffin scored her goal, midway through the second period, cutting JapanÂs lead to 2-1, the crowd leapt to its feet and roared with joy.

For many fans, the political and historic charge of the game was the point.

ÂI am not very interested in hockey,Â said Cho Young-kyu, 20, who attended with a group of friends. ÂI decided to come here because it is a game between Korea and Japan and it is a unified Korean team.Â

Mr. Cho, who wore a baseball hat with a peace symbol embroidered on it and carried both a South Korean and a unity flag, took glee in pointing out a couple of tiny dots on the unified flag. They represented islands in the sea between Japan and the Korean Peninsula, known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan, that are administered by South Korea but claimed by Japan. ÂThese are our islands, not JapanÂs islands,Â he said.

Given the circumstances, WednesdayÂs game played out with civility. When Japan scored, there was no booing. Instead, Korean fans quickly rebounded with chants of ÂItÂs O.K.!Â The Japanese fans applauded the Korean team at the end of the game.

Over all, relations between Japan and South Korea have been on a long-term upward trend. In the late 1990s, South Korea dropped its bans against Japanese films, videos and comic books, and began allowing Japanese performers into the country. In 2002, when the countries co-hosted the World Cup, even after JapanÂs team was eliminated, fans rooted for South Korea.

But under Mr. Abe, the relationship between the countries has deteriorated. In 2013, Mr. AbeÂs party proposed new language for school textbooks that inserted a more nationalist tone, requiring the history books state that there is still a dispute about whether the Japanese Army played a direct role in forcing so-called comfort women from Korea and elsewhere to work as sex slaves for its soldiers. Most foreign historians say the brothels could not have been run without the militaryÂs cooperation.

The countries signed an agreement in 2015 to resolve the comfort women dispute, but after the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, was elected last fall, he pledged to review the deal. In January, Mr. Moon said he would leave the deal intact, but he called for a renewed and sincere apology from Japan, a declaration that provoked frustration in Tokyo. At a summit meeting with Mr. Moon immediately before the start of the Olympics, Mr. Abe reiterated JapanÂs position that the 2015 agreement should be Âfinal and irreversible.Â

But it was the presence of North Korea that has threatened to open the biggest gap between Japan and the South.

ÂNorth Korean media and propaganda still remain heavily anti-Japanese, and the North Korean leadership familyÂs legitimacy is largely based on their anti-Japanese fight,Â said Gordon Flake, the chief executive of the Perth USAsia Centre at the University of Western Australia. ÂSo you have this family and this culture and society who havenÂt begun the process of reconciliation, so by definition, any time you have a unified Korean effort it will be relatively more hostile to Japan.Â

Indeed, during the pairs figure skating short program on Wednesday morning, the North Korean cheerleaders in the stands cheered for the South Korean pair and politely applauded skaters from other countries including China, Russia, Austria and the Czech Republic. But when a Japanese pair skated, the cheerleaders sat with their hands on their knees and did not clap.

South KoreaÂs emerging dÃ©tente with North Korea worries Japan, which has so far stuck firmly with the Trump administration in calling for implementing sanctions and predicating any substantial talks with the North on denuclearization.

Observers say that ultimately, Japan and South Korea have too much in common to let the diplomatic fireworks of the Olympics derail a long-term relationship. ÂThereÂs almost a recognition that these historical issues are going to continue to irritate and even at times undermine the ability of Tokyo and Seoul to work together,Â said Kathleen Stephens, a former United States ambassador to South Korea and a fellow at Stanford UniversityÂs Asia-Pacific Research Center.

ÂBut I think the South Korean public is pretty sophisticated about this,Â she added. ÂAnd they do have a shared interest in trying to work together on the North Korean nuclear missile and defense issues.Â

Each team could point to a milestone after the game. JapanÂs win was its first in three trips to the Olympics. GriffinÂs goal was KoreaÂs first in the Pyeongchang Games, a bright spot for a team Â bolstered not only by a dozen North Koreans but also several players raised in North America Â that surrendered 20 goals in its three games.

For some fans, that highlight offered a ray of hope in defeat. When Griffin scored, Park In-heang, 54, watching from the stands, said he was moved by the possibility that sports might plant the seed of peace.

ÂThis is our first goal,Â he said. ÂIt makes me see the future.Â
