WASHINGTON Â On the mezzanine of the Kennedy Center Opera House on Sunday night, the seats for a star-studded class of honorees were carefully spaced in an effort to disguise the obvious: The president, a traditional guest of the Kennedy Center Honors, was missing.

It was only the fourth time in 40 years that a sitting United States president skipped the gala, which honors the lifetime achievements of artistic trailblazers in music, dance and entertainment Â and the first time that the absence was not because of a national crisis or convention. President Trump did not attend to avoid Âpolitical distraction,Â according to a statement from the White House, but it emboldened honorees to air their angst.

ÂWe happen to have somebody in the White House who doesnÂt care about the arts and humanities,Â said Norman Lear, the television producer and progressive activist who received the lifetime artistic achievement award. ÂI think he was smart to stay away and stay out of town Â which is something he does on weekends anyway. Nothing new.Â

At a State Department dinner for the honorees Â Mr. Lear, LL Cool J, Carmen de Lavallade, Gloria Estefan and Lionel Richie Â on Saturday night, Julie Andrews, the actress and master of ceremonies, urged attendees to Âstep away from divisive discourseÂ for the weekend.

For political figures like Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, the invitation was welcome. Under the glistening chandelier of the Thomas Jefferson Room, an enthralled Ms. Pelosi embraced LL Cool J and inquired at length about distinctions between rap and hip-hop. (ÂHip-hop is the culture surrounding it: these earrings, this hat,Â he explained. ÂAnd the dancing!Â she squealed.)

ÂArt helps us understand each other,Â Ms. Pelosi said in an interview. ÂI truly believe this: Whatever political party, our differences are shed when you engage in the arts.Â

But moments later, Ms. Pelosi was seated three tables away from Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, the eveningÂs host, whose appointment she once called a Âdisturbing signalÂ of the Trump administrationÂs foreign policy motives. Throughout the night, Ms. Pelosi patted the shoulder of Ms. de Lavallade, a dancer and choreographer who, along with Mr. Lear, refused to meet with the president at the White House. (The offer was later retracted.)

Some of Saturday eveningÂs political commentary was jocular: David Rubenstein, the chairman of the Kennedy Center, advised Mr. Tillerson to quell the rage of Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, by offering him a new hairstylist Â or Mr. LearÂs signature hat.

But much of it meandered into weightier territory, including immigration policy. In a speech, the actress Rita Moreno quoted a segment of the State DepartmentÂs official mission to foster conditions for the betterment of Âpeople everywhere.Â

ÂSome of us have rattled the chains for issues of justice,Â said Ms. Moreno, a Puerto Rican friend of the honoree Ms. Estefan, who is Cuban-American. ÂWell, mi amiga, Gloria, it is not lost on me tonight that one immigrant girl will honor another.Â

In accepting the award, Ms. Estefan underscored the fragility of freedom. ÂPeople here think you can never lose this, but you can lose this,Â she said. ÂWe all have to stand up for what this country is, for its values.Â

In light of the eventÂs 40th anniversary, SundayÂs lavish tribute Â where a single seat costs up to $6,000 Â was even more special. Multicolored ribbons were draped from cables over the red carpet in the Hall of States. The rainbow palette of the medallions illuminated the marble perimeter of the Kennedy Center and the bronze bust of President John F. Kennedy.

And while the nightÂs focus was on the honorees, Caroline Kennedy opened the program with a pointed quotation from her father: ÂThe men who create power make an indispensable contribution to the nationÂs greatness, but the men who question power make a contribution just as indispensable, especially when that questioning is disinterested, for they determine whether we use power or power uses us.Â

Among the dozens of tributes Â from Stevie Wonder, Misty Copeland, Dave Chappelle and Queen Latifah Â was a student of Ms. de LavalladeÂs at Yale: Meryl Streep.

Mr. Trump criticized Ms. Streep after the Golden Globes in January, which began a year of tension with the arts community. The presidentÂs spring budget proposal suggested eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts. In August, all 16 private members of the PresidentÂs Committee on the Arts and the Humanities resigned in light of Mr. TrumpÂs response to white nationalist activity in Charlottesville, Va.

ÂThis is the moment, year after year, when the president of the United States Â the most senior individual in the land Â comes to pay respects to artists,Â Deborah Rutter, the president of the Kennedy Center, said in an interview. ÂThe arts are a reflection of whatÂs happening in America. We miss the president, weÂre sorry heÂs not here Â but we totally get it.Â

The Kennedy Center Honors will be broadcast on CBS on Dec. 26 at 9 p.m. Eastern.

Germany is mired in a political crisis. Less than two months after what seemed to be an electoral victory, Chancellor Angela Merkel is struggling to form a government and has said that if she fails, she prefers new elections over a minority government. As Germany tries to find its way, here are some of our best stories about the country from recent months.

Angela Merkel has spent 12 years at the helm of the largest, richest country in Europe, but has never liked being Âsingled out or being put on a pedestal,Â her biographer says. Faced with aggressive leaders in Russia, Turkey, Hungary, and Poland, she has had leadership thrust upon her, and become a more outspoken defender of human rights, sympathy toward refugees and the need to reduce carbon emissions.

Germany is one of the few world powers to be led by a woman, but Ms. MerkelÂs prominence has not made as much impact on the countryÂs gender bias as some would have hoped for. Alice Schwarzer, the countryÂs best-known feminist, put it this way: ÂSince 2005, little girls can decide: Do I become a hairdresser Â or chancellor?Â Our correspondent Katrin Bennhold investigated this contradiction.

A surge in support for the far right in SeptemberÂs election gave some Germans cause for introspection. Many believed that their countryÂs liberal democracy was unshakable, and for them, the nearly 13 percent of votes won by the Alternative for Germany party was a bitter pill to swallow. Read more Â»
