['Planning a vacation? Chances are youll think about it differently than you do that business trip youre also arranging.', 'For the vacation, you may scroll through hotel reviews before deciding where to stay, not just to compare prices but also to consider the amenities offered.', 'For the business trip, on the other hand, you may be inclined to book a hotel that offers rewards for frequent guests instead of the one with the lowest nightly rate. It is company money youre spending, after all.', 'Leisure travelers are naturally more selective and cost conscious than business travelers. But a new breed of start-ups that caters to corporate travelers and focuses on user behavior may be making those distinctions obsolete.', 'The premise behind these companies, including Rocketrip, TripActions and Upside, is that if business travelers were rewarded for making choices that save their companies money, they would act accordingly.', 'Upside officially started in January, and more than 10,000 companies in the United States are already using it to book employee travel, according to its founder, Jay Walker. TripActions, which began offering its services in 2015, does not disclose its user figures but has attracted companies like SurveyMonkey and eHarmony, said its founder and chief executive, Ariel Cohen. Rocketrip, which has been around since 2013, is the preferred booking tool of General Electric, Twitter and 50 to 100 other Fortune 100 and midsize businesses, Dan Ruch, its founder and chief executive, said.', 'Mr. Ruch, of Manhattan, got into the business of offering incentives to business travelers after learning about how Google employees travel.', 'I came up with the concept in 2012, but it wasnt really my idea, he said. We stumbled onto Googles approach, which has been in place at least a decade. The Google method includes drawing up a budget for airfare and hotels before every trip. If employees come in under budget, they earn credits that can be redeemed for travel upgrades in the future. The approach is different from gamified booking tools that encourage certain behavior, like using a preferred carrier, but generally do not let employees share in the savings.', 'Rocketrip, like Google, allows travelers to keep half of what they save. Instead of travel upgrades, it offers gift cards to Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers through a so-called rewards store.', 'Mr. Ruch calls the system incentivized behavioral change, and he said it was either the most radical concept in corporate travel, or the most obvious.', 'Theres such an enormous amount of inefficiency in business travel, he said. If your companys policy allows business class on flights over six hours, it is not expected behavior to fly coach. If your policy allows five-star hotels, it is not expected behavior to stay at a three-star hotel or to stay with a friend.', 'People are naturally drawn to comfort, Mr. Ruch said, meaning that unless they know they will be rewarded for cutting corners, they will indulge their inclination to make business travel as cushy, and as expensive, as possible.', 'Mark Mintman, the director of finance at AAF International, an air filter company in Louisville, Ky., said he had seen Mr. Ruchs theory in action. Before AAF started using Rocketrip last fall, the companys roughly 100 traveling employees submitted trip budgets to management before booking.', 'There was really no incentive to save, he said. Once Rocketrip and its Budget to Beat formulas were adopted, Mr. Mintman said, AAF employees started to save the company 15 to 20 percent, or roughly $133, per trip. Travelers see how much they can earn for each cost-saving option  staying with a friend instead of staying at a hotel, for example  through Rocketrips online booking tool.', 'Ive seen some extreme examples of people getting into it, Mr. Mintman said. Colleagues who once stayed at a Hilton are now staying at the less expensive Microtel. And, he added, Ive had guys stay in hotels 45 minutes away from where they need to be, just to generate savings. Instead of being loyal to a Starwood or a Marriott account, now theyre loyal to saving the company money.', 'Rocketrip, like other start-ups applying a carrot-and-stick approach to travel, also gives reports to company managers about how much was saved and which action  settling, say, for a cheaper hotel or a coach seat  caused the savings on each trip, Mr. Ruch said. If an employee goes over the budget to beat figure, management sees that, too.', 'Mr. Mintman said that working with Rocketrip had helped AAF determine what was reasonable for a travel budget. Now, we can go back to someones proposed spending on a trip and see how well it lines up with what Rocketrip has come up with, he said.', 'TripActions, which gives users who save their companies money TripBucks redeemable for gift cards, upgrades and vacations, claims it can cut travel costs as much as 30 percent per trip. (Mr. Ruch said the average Rocketrip user saves the company 24 percent.)', 'The TripActions app lets users specify airplane seat preferences, loyalty club memberships and other personal details before booking. It also allows for last-minute itinerary changes and features a chat line, should complications arise.', 'David Rowley, vice president for customer experience at Jive Communications, a tech company in Utah, likes TripActions emphasis on customer service.', 'Im leaving for a trip on Monday, so I know Ill get a call from them on Sunday afternoon letting me know my flights are still on schedule, he said. He also likes the TripBucks, which accrue the more you travel and the more you save. Mr. Rowley said he had earned $1,700 in rewards and had saved Jive $7,500 since the company started using TripActions at the end of last year. He cashes in his TripBucks for Amazon gift cards.', 'My daughter is getting married, so Im using TripBucks to buy things for her wedding, he said. Honestly, Ive learned from using TripActions that travel really is a behavioral thing. I used to wait until the last minute if I needed to go somewhere. Like, Id book my tickets late so I could get into a certain hotel. But now I book months in advance because Im looking to save some money and earn some rewards.', 'Upside, a third venture developed with the goal of getting business travelers to think like consumers, bypasses travel managers and works directly with employees.', 'We target any company that doesnt have a travel department, said Mr. Walker, who was also the founder of Priceline. Essentially, if your company asks you to buy your own travel, were there for you.', 'Savings are generated by bundling flights and hotels. Upside buys the flight and hotel packages at wholesale prices, then sells them to customers at what Mr. Walker called a lower retail. Rates, he said, were usually 5 to 10 percent off rates at sites like Expedia, and users earn gift cards every time they book a trip. The average card earned for a domestic trip is $100 to $200. (Participating retailers include Amazon and Home Depot.) Values run higher, usually around $200, for international travelers. Companies typically save 5 to 15 percent when employees book through Upside, Mr. Walker said.', 'Kurt Hosna, global communications director at a Boston human resources management company, said he had used Upside since it started. So far, he has redeemed roughly $1,000 in rewards, much of it for gear for his cycling hobby.', 'Before he and his colleagues started using Upside, Mr. Hosna said, they tried to be good sports about not overspending on travel. His companys pat-on-the-back approach to acknowledging their conscientiousness was nice, he said. But Upsides gift cards have been nicer. Giving people real rewards just makes sense, he said.', 'Good Tuesday.

Rather than let market forces decide what should happen in the chip industry, the administration intervened because it had concerns about national security. One of the government's main worries, laid out in a March 5 letter, was that Broadcom would reduce Qualcomms spending on research and development, causing Qualcomm to lose ground in the race to develop important new technologies like 5G, which is designed to make wireless networks faster and more reliable. Chinese companies may gain an advantage in 5G, for instance.", 'Qualcomm does spend a lot on research and development. In its last fiscal year, the companys $5.5 billion of research and development outlays were equivalent to 25 percent of its revenue. That was up from 21 percent on average in the preceding five years. According to Qualcomm executives, spending on 5G has driven the increase.', 'The big question is what Qualcomm does now. Will the company become less efficient under the governments protection? Will it be tempted to spend less on research and development? If that spending falls markedly as a percentage of revenue, United States taxpayers may have reason to feel taken advantage of.', ' Peter Eavis', 'The Trump administration seems to have taken a more activist role in mergers and acquisitions than past administrations.', 'On Monday, President Trump blocked Broadcoms hostile bid for Qualcomm.

Though many firms garnered headlines for doling out bonuses to employees or raising hourly wages, analysts and economists largely predicted that corporate America would turn to deal-making, dividends or share buybacks as ways to spend their money.', 'At the end of the day, tax is not a driver of M.&A., but it certainly is a key element, Bill Casey, EYs Americas vice chair of transaction advisory services, told me. He added that the removal of uncertainty about taxes, as well as the potential benefits from the overhaul, appears to have lifted companies deal-making spirits.', 'Not that M.&A. has been bad so far this year. Announced transactions in the United States for the year to date are up 55 percent from the same time last year, according to Thomson Reuters. And Mr. Casey pointed out that companies already have access to plenty of cheap financing to pursue acquisitions.', 'But for mid-market companies especially, extra money in the pocket can help provide an extra shot of confidence.', 'Theres more capital being fueled by tax reform, and that will ultimately lead to a better deal market, Mr. Casey said.', 'Other findings from the survey', ' 75 percent of respondents said that they are likely to grow their United States manufacturing base in some way', ' 89 percent said that they planned to enhance compensation because of forthcoming tax benefits', ' 38 percent of mid-cap companies plan to create new jobs, compared to only 19 percent of large-caps', ' 66 percent are likely to pass some tax savings onto customers', ' Michael de la Merced', 'Few deal makers that Michael has spoken to since last night can recall such a dramatic scenario: The president intervening in a hostile takeover, citing national security reasons.', 'President Trump essentially salted the earth for Broadcoms bid for Qualcomm.

Already, big business groups are lining up to support the White Houses efforts.', 'The Business Roundtable, which represents chief executives of the largest companies, has started an advertising campaign calling for a tax overhaul that is supported by the White House, the Treasury Department and Republican congressional leadership.', 'Such coordination between industry groups and the White House stands in contrast to last weeks unraveling of the business advisory groups, but confirms what many in the corporate world say: Behind the scenes, there is still active dialogue between business groups and the administration.', 'We have had broad access to the administration and cabinet members, said Mr. Howard, who has been in associations and lobbying groups for 30 years. Our access, and their receptivity to our requests for meetings, has been better than Ive ever seen.', 'Four people in particular have emerged as go-to contacts for executives and lobbyists seeking to sway the debate: Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell; and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.', 'All four are familiar faces to business leaders. Mr. Cohn, Mr. Mnuchin and Ms. Powell are alumni of Goldman Sachs, the powerful investment bank, and Mr. Ross ran a private equity firm.', 'Expectations of a more stable partnership with business appeared to hearten investors. The major stock market indexes rose sharply on Tuesday, in part buoyed by investor hopes that with the departure of Mr. Bannon, more pragmatic voices within the administration will gain strength, possibly resulting in a tax overhaul bill. The benchmark Standard & Poors 500-stock index closed up nearly 1 percent, its biggest gain in a week.', 'I think investors are picking up on this, said Jim Paulsen, a stock market strategist for the Leuthold Group, an investment firm based in Minneapolis. We now have people around the president who are more moderate and pro-business, like Gary Cohn.', 'Mr. Paulsen also suggested that Mr. Trumps measured speech on Monday about sending more troops to Afghanistan could be seen by those still willing to bet on the Trump economy that there is now change within the administration.', 'Even as corporate leaders criticized the president, industry representatives and lobbyists have continued to press various agencies in Mr. Trumps administration. At the Environmental Protection Agency, industry groups have attained significant influence as Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A.s administrator, has rolled back regulations.', 'Still, repairing relations with the White House itself will take time. While the Business Roundtable is supporting efforts for tax reform, its chairman, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has joined the chorus of leaders criticizing Mr. Trump last week.', 'I strongly disagree with President Trumps reaction to the events that took place in Charlottesville over the past several days, Mr. Dimon wrote on Twitter.', 'The schism between Mr. Trump and top chief executives is real, and could have meaningful implications.', 'Former White House officials and executives said that while it is useful for executives to interact with cabinet-level officials and members of the vice presidents staff, such relationships are no substitute to a working relationship with the Oval Office.', 'You will see a lot of connecting points at the cabinet level, and thats natural and good, said Mack McLarty, President Bill Clintons first chief of staff. But at the end of the day, the president is going to make the final decision on policies and how legislation is approached. So there has got to be some ability for businesses, hopefully large and small, to engage with this administration, as there was such great promise going in.', 'There are even questions about whether or not the executives who once made up his advisory councils will be willing to speak out in support of causes they shared with the White House, including a tax code overhaul.', 'For this president, losing both councils is terrifically challenging, said Richard Levick, founder of the Washington public relations firm Levick. They were more than symbolic. These C.E.O.s were going to be the ambassadors for the administration to talk about tax reform, about health care reform, about infrastructure.', 'And there are other issues where business interests and the wishes of the White House diverge.', 'Mr. Trumps nominee to lead the Export-Import Bank, which supports American exports, is facing stiff opposition from business groups.', 'The nominee, Scott Garrett, a former congressman from New Jersey once said Ex-Im, as it is known, embodies the corruption of the free enterprise system.', 'That has rattled big companies such as Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar, which rely on Ex-Im to help finance their overseas sales.', 'Now, as the prospect of hearings and a confirmation vote on Mr. Garretts appointment draw closer, big business groups have stepped up their efforts to quash his nomination. The National Association of Manufacturers is leading a campaign to drum up opposition to Mr. Garrett.', 'And the Business Roundtable spoke out against Mr. Garrett on Twitter, writing BRT cannot support Scott Garrett or any #ExIm nominee who does not demonstrate strong support for the bank and commitment to get it promptly back to work, fully executing its mission.', 'It is not clear if Mr. Garrett will lead Ex-Im, or if the efforts to derail his nomination will succeed. But even if big companies are able to sway the administration on the Ex-Im leadership, and even if a tax overhaul is enacted, it may be some time before corporate chieftains want to sit alongside Mr. Trump again.', 'Our clients were coming to me eight months ago and saying, What if we are the victims of a nasty Trump tweet? Mr. Levick said. Now theyre saying, What do we do if the president wants a photo op? You dont want to be seen with this president.', 'Andrew Ross Sorkin was a 24-year-old mergers and acquisitions reporter for The New York Times when, in 2001, he began sending a daily email roundup to his readers. He called it DealBook.', 'Now, almost 17 years later, DealBook is an integral part of The Timess news report  and has expanded its coverage in print, on the web and through an annual conference.', 'In the meantime, Mr. Sorkin, who first wrote for The Times while still in high school, has written a best-selling book (Too Big to Fail), won two Gerald Loeb Awards and helped create a television series, Billions, for Showtime. He is also a co-anchor of Squawk Box, a financial news program on CNBC.', 'What follows is a lightly edited Q. and A. about the origins  and the future  of DealBook, which relaunched in November.', '_____', 'Were expanding our mandate to become a smartly curated, one-stop shop for all the days key business and policy news and analysis in real time.', 'The business world is now inextricably linked with policy  in Washington, in Brussels, in Beijing  in a way that it has never been before. Corporate C.E.O.s and investors increasingly spend as much time in D.C. as they do on Wall Street. Business has become politics. And politics is business.', 'Thats why were relaunching DealBook with a renewed focus on the intersection of these crosscurrents, leveraging the entire reporting staff of The New York Times for our deeply loyal reader base of influential business and policy leaders and an expanding global audience.', 'Were going to be touching on everything from lobbying to technology to taxes to automations impact on jobs to the business communitys approach to climate change.', 'Our goal is to bring readers unique insights and exclusive behind-the-scenes details about the days most important headlines. And of course, we will continue to cover the world of deal making and finance.', 'It was 2001. The Times had just asked me to move back from London, where I had been covering mergers in Europe for the paper, to New York to take over the merger beat here.', 'As I went around meeting people on Wall Street, it occurred to me that many of them were spending as much of the day as I did trying to piece together various news reports, to stay up-to-date. I figured there could be value in curating a daily report that put all of the news together from all sorts of news sources, and in prioritizing the news in a way that made sense for this audience.', 'Back then, the idea of linking to a competitor, whether it be The Wall Street Journal or The Financial Times, was considered treasonous. Blogging was in its infancy. And the real insight was to send the report by email every morning, putting it at the top of everyones inbox when they woke up.', 'Back then, by the way, we used to get requests to send the newsletter by fax!', 'Over time, as our readership increased from a couple hundred to over 300,000, DealBook moved from being put together by me in my pajamas at home at 5 in the morning, supported by a small team, to a larger and larger team. We started our website in 2006 and began doing much more original reporting and offering analysis throughout the day. In 2010, we grew even bigger.', 'Along the way, we added an annual conference, a daily page in the newspaper, two annual special sections and more.', 'One of the best parts of this project: Weve been able to hire some amazingly talented people over the years, many of whom now populate all different parts of the paper. Among them: Susanne Craig (who famously got President Trumps old tax records in the mail); Azam Ahmed, the bureau chief for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean; Ben Protess, who now covers the Trump administration and its potential conflicts of interests; Kevin Roose, our newest business columnist with The Shift; Alexandra Stevenson, a correspondent in Hong Kong; and Adrienne Carter, who is now the deputy business editor.', 'Michael Schmidt, a star in our Washington bureau, did some writing for us early on in his career  as did Thomas Kaplan, who now covers Congress and was once on loan to us as a summer intern. Michael J. de la Merced, our most prolific DealBook writer and a mainstay of the report, started working with us all the way back in 2006.', 'The Times was pretty early in developing email newsletters. However, many were just automated lists of headlines. It was the addition of truly original writing and reporting that really elevated The Timess newsletters in recent years.', 'Readers have gravitated to email newsletters  theyre the best way to cut through the overwhelming nature of everything online.', 'For me, I have always been driven by trying to figure out what the reader wants  and what they need.', 'Whenever I finish an interview for a story, I often ask this series of questions: What do you read? Whats wrong with it? Whats missing? What do you wish you had that you dont have?', 'Everything that Ive ever built has come from trying to fulfill the answers to those questions.', 'On a sales trip last fall to Seoul, South Korea, Josh Udashkin, the founder of the smart luggage company Raden, quickly realized that hed better leave the matte-finish suitcase samples in his hotel room.', 'The retail displays, the street fashion, shoes, purses, headphones, showed me that shiny surfaces were definitely popular in Seoul, he said. Instead, he brought only the shiny-surface samples to his meeting at a Korean department store. The visit was successful, and the store plans to stock Mr. Udashkins wares this fall.', 'The lesson was simple. Putting in time to understand the local culture is key to success abroad, Mr. Udashkin said. If you think, My product was so successful in New York or L.A., of course it will sell here, he said, you are setting yourself up to fail.', 'Business travelers hoping to improve their professional prospects by understanding local culture and business customs can take a path similar to Mr. Udashkins and spend time observing the culture firsthand and asking colleagues about their experiences. They now also have a panoply of other choices, including websites, apps and business-focused tour guides.', 'To prepare for his trip to Seoul, Mr. Udashkin said, he learned some common phrases using the Duolingo smartphone app, looked at Korean fashion websites and read up on the local news. He also asked friends from Korea about business practices. They advised him to study up on business card exchange etiquette.', 'The more you can prepare in advance, said Manny Cowan, the head of global mobility services at the World Bank, the sooner you can get to your mission and why you are there.', 'Preparing for the way a business meeting is conducted can be as important as what is presented there, said Ruihua Dong, who leads intercultural training at the World Bank. Hierarchical communication, gender norms and attitudes toward punctuality can differ widely, and knowing the traditions can help visitors avoid misunderstandings, she said.', 'If you show up on time to an important meeting and the local person comes 30 minutes late, its not necessarily an insult, Ms. Dong said. They just may have a different definition of what is punctual in their culture.', 'Jeremy Podeswa, who directed six episodes of Game of Thrones, travels the world to film the HBO series, managing hundreds of people on sets in three different countries. For him, he said, it was important to know beforehand which cultures dont mind working overtime and which expect a shorter day on the set. In some cultures, he said, there is a little more of a feeling that we work to live as opposed to living for work.', 'Ms. Dong said some countries business dealings are more task-oriented while others are relationship-oriented. A business partner may want to share a meal when you arrive, and you may be thinking, I need to get to work, she said. But the social interaction during the meal may set the stage for the tasks ahead.', 'Expert-led tours are becoming more of an option for business travelers seeking to soak up local knowledge. Context Travel, an American tour company, introduced two-hour sessions in some Asian and European cities called Welcome to about three years ago. While the program was originally designed for tourists, Paul Bennett, the companys founder, said hes seen a significant increase in session bookings by business travelers over the past year.', 'Each Welcome to  session begins with a one-hour introduction to the city and includes maps, basic phrases in the local language and cultural information based on the travelers needs. A neighborhood walk follows, including instruction on how to use public transportation if needed. It sets the traveler up, Mr. Bennett said.', 'Recent clients booking a Welcome to session included a group of American doctors coming to Shanghai for a medical conference. By learning a bit about cultural customs, local news and the history of the city, the doctors felt they could accelerate their conversations with their Chinese counterparts, Mr. Bennett said. They had only a few days to interact on important medical issues, and they hoped to minimize the usual introductory awkwardness and go deeper and make the most out of their time, he said.', 'Each area of the world has its own particular practices. Along with personal consultations and regional support teams, the World Bank offers its employees a website with information on how to live and work effectively in 120 locations. We do it for people coming to the U.S. to work as well, Mr. Cowan said.', 'Mr. Bennett, of Context, said that some of his business clients were feeling more self-conscious recently about traveling as an American abroad. The America first stance of the White House puts them in a defensive position when they go in to negotiate a business deal, Mr. Bennett said. Business travelers are coming to us to learn about the culture they will be working with because they want to be viewed as partners, he said.', 'Mr. Udashkin, of Raden, said he liked to absorb the local culture in person. In addition to Seoul, he has traveled to Paris, Milan, London and Hong Kong in the last 18 months to show his suitcases to retailers. He said he would arrive in each city a day or more before his meetings and walk around looking for local taste indicators like the popular models or hues of products like iPhones and Beats headphones.', 'Im not looking for the outliers, he said, I want to know how to fit into the local mainstream.', 'James Garish is no spelling bee champ, but he never forgot the tricky string of letters that add up to the last name of his kindergarten crush, Elizabeth Stipkovits. He also never forgot the girl behind the name. Which is why he typed it into his laptop one lonely night in 2010 while serving in the Army in Iraq.', 'I was just sitting there in my bunk, and I started wondering how life had turned out for her, said Mr. Garish, 34. McKeesport, Pa., the working-class city where he and Ms. Stipkovits grew up, wasnt always reminiscent of picnics and parades for Mr. Garish; he dropped out of school at 14 and spent more than half a decade in dead-end jobs before enlisting in the Army in 2008.', 'Still, he wasnt immune to homesickness. So upon finding Ms. Stipkovitss profile on Facebook, he sent a friend request.', 'Ms. Stipkovits, half a world away raising her 6-year-old daughter, Maleena, had no idea who he was. I saw the request and his name sounded familiar. But I couldnt place it, she said. She called her mother, Joy Stipkovits, who did recall a James Garish.', 'She told me I was in kindergarten with him. Then I remembered, Ms. Stipkovits said. He was Little Bad Jimmy, the class clown, the holy terror, the one always getting yelled at by the teacher. That the onetime 5-year-old handful remembered her and her hard-to-spell name stopped her in her tracks. I thought that said a lot.', 'The relationship that has unspooled since that 2010 friend request has bound together Mr. Garish and Ms. Stipkovits in a foxhole of determination, love and brokenness. In 2014, when she was 31, Ms. Stipkovits received her first breast cancer diagnosis. Since then, the cancer has returned twice and metastasized. At the end of 2017, she was being treated for cancer in her femur and lung. In January, it had spread to her brain. Little Bad Jimmy, now a supervisor at a McKeesport Rite-Aid, has never left her side.', 'We tell people I was his rock when he was in Iraq, and hes been my rock through the crazy roller-coaster ride of the last four years, said Ms. Stipkovits, 34. Chemo has taken a lot of my memory. But he always reminds me hes been in love with me since kindergarten.', 'Mr. Garish had only six months left in his three years of active duty when he and Ms. Stipkovits reunited through Facebook. Within weeks, they were phone friends, then long-distance girlfriend and boyfriend. Her calls brought relief from his high-stakes job as an escort for explosive ordnance disposal specialists, the military experts who get rid of explosive weapons.', 'We would go out on up to seven missions a day. Things get a little crazy over there. It was stressful and I was sleep deprived. One of the things I looked forward to most was talking on the phone with Liz, said Mr. Garish, who was with the third infantry division based at Fort Stewart, Ga.', 'Ms. Stipkovits remembers conversations cut painfully short because of poor reception, and the swell of anticipation mixed with compassion and admiration that would kick in when a call from Iraq reached her in McKeesport.', 'My dad served in Kuwait and is a retired chief in the Navy, she said. I knew how Jim felt being away from his friends and family, and that sometimes you just really need someone to vent to. She was delighted to be his someone. When Mr. Garish impulsively bought a plane ticket home for Christmas in 2010, she was even more delighted by the surprise of him on her front porch.', 'It was dark out and he pulled me close, and it felt good, Ms. Stipkovits said. We hadnt seen each other in a lot of years. Mr. Garish and Ms. Stipkovits had attended the same schools until eighth grade, shortly before he dropped out. But beyond kindergarten, their classes and social circles never overlapped. We didnt miss a beat, she said.', 'She hadnt expected such a smooth in-person reunion. Not because she didnt expect the former unruly schoolboy to be so thoroughly rehabilitated, but because she wasnt sure how her life as a single mother would look to Mr. Garish from up close. Ms. Stipkovits has never been married and had Maleena at 19.', 'By the following summer, when Mr. Garish completed his service and moved back to McKeesport, he was weaving Maleena into his life, and vice versa. Just as she didnt expect Mr. Garish to be sympathetic to her single-parent status, she didnt expect her daughter to fall for the soft-spoken stranger-soldier whose personality had done a U-turn in the 22 years that had passed since kindergarten.', 'But her daughter did. Mr. Garish spent most of that summer at Ms. Stipkovitss house, coloring and playing games with Maleena while Ms. Stipkovits, then still healthy, worked 9 to 5 as a medical receptionist.', 'Reintegration to civilian life, Mr. Garish was finding, was a process. It was taking a while. One of the things I noticed was, I was really tense, he said. The neighborhood I lived in wasnt the safest, and I had to give myself time to readjust to the point where I could be in groups of people and not freak out. Long afternoons spent with Maleena helped. Shes got her mamas attitude. Shes a tough little kid.', 'Mr. Garish had never been married and had no children, but he had previously shown an inclination, maybe fueled by his own difficult school days, to care for them. Before he reunited with Ms. Stipkovits in 2010, he donated much of his first Army paycheck, around $600, to Jamies Dream Team, a local charity. The money helped a 6-year-old boy suffering from the genetic disorder Marfan syndrome go on a long-wished-for camping trip.', 'He had nearly forgotten about Jamies Dream Team seven years later when the charity offered to throw him and Ms. Stipkovits a wedding. In the whirl of surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation that had become his life with Ms. Stipkovits since they discovered her cancer in 2014, planning a wedding seemed as ridiculous as Ms. Stipkovitss reaction when he proposed on Aug. 20, 2017.', 'On that day, Ms. Stipkovits, who had a heart condition (a side effect of the cancer treatments), was being fitted with a vest, which acts as a portable defibrillator, at UPMC Shadyside Hospital in Pittsburgh. Mr. Garish, sitting on her bedside, was moved in the moment to ask a question of the heart.', 'He said, I think we deserve something good to happen. Will you marry me? Ms. Stipkovits said. He had no ring and only part-time work at a local Rite-Aid. He had, though, a high school equivalency diploma and the G.I. Bill had helped him get into Penn State, where he graduated with a degree in business in 2015. He spends most of his time caring for Ms. Stipkovits and Maleena, now 14.', 'She laughed. It was just so funny, she said. I was in a hospital bed, dying. I looked at him and said, You just want the insurance money.', 'But behind the laughter was elation. I had the same wish every little girl does of a fairy-tale wedding, the crystals and the Cinderella ball gown. And I always told myself that if I found someone who bonded with my daughter in the manner he did, I would marry him. Watching the two of them interact, and the way hes stuck by me, I would be a fool not to marry him.', 'She said yes.', 'The fairy-tale fantasy, complete with crystal ball gown, though, was far out of reach. Not only were the hospital stays adding up, so were the hospital bills. Ms. Stipkovits and Maleena are being supported by family and Mr. Garish; she has long been too sick to work.', 'But there are those around McKeesport who believe in making dreams come true.', 'Liz is an amazing young woman. Shes always optimistic and shes been fighting a long time now, said Lori McKown, an oncology social worker at the hospital. Doctors have not told Ms. Stipkovits how long she can expect to keep fighting. But time is of the essence, and I wanted to do something, Ms. McKown said. In late 2017, she started contacting charities.', 'It was a snowy day and I was sitting at my desk looking out at the window. I thought, This couple wants to get married, and theyre putting their plans off because of her illness, she said. A colleague told her about Jamies Dream Team.', 'Little did I know her fiancé had donated his first paycheck there, she said.', 'Jamie Holmes, the founder of Jamies Dream Team, hadnt forgotten Mr. Garish. I was like, absolutely were going to put on a wedding for them, she said.', 'On Feb. 17, only two months after Jamies Dream Team rallied more than a dozen Pittsburgh-area vendors to supply things like flowers, a wedding cake and a photo booth, Mr. Garish and Ms. Stipkovits were married before 200 guests at Old Stone Church in Monroeville, Pa.', 'Ms. Stipkovits, flanked by four bridesmaids and Maleena, her maid of honor, wore a full-length white dress sewn with Swarovski crystals provided by the Exquisite Bride in Murrysville, Pa.; her hair, full despite several years of on-and-off chemotherapy, was swept into a side ponytail. Her father, Joe Stipkovits, walked her down the aisle. Mr. Garish, in a black tuxedo with blue vest instead of his Army uniform, still wore a buzz cut. Capt. Tracy Lostaunau, an Army chaplain from Aspinwall, Pa., was secured by Jamies Dream Team to officiate.', 'After a short ceremony punctuated by pauses so Ms. Stipkovits, who is currently on dialysis, could catch her breath and dab at relentless tears, Ms. Stipkovits and Mr. Garish joined their friends and families for a reception at the Cathedral Room at St, Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in Pittsburgh.', 'Guests, who feasted on fried chicken, baked ziti and macaroni and cheese provided by area restaurants, didnt seem worried when Ms. Stipkovits fell after Mr. Garish playfully pushed a piece of red velvet cake, iced in pink, toward his new wifes face. She quickly got up. As her father, Joe Stipkovits said, This is the most energetic Ive seen her in quite some time.', 'Weve had more trials and tribulations than most married couples have in a lifetime, Ms. Stipkovits said just before the wedding. I told Jim, When we say our vows, the only thing well have left to accomplish is till death do us part.', 'Her daughter, Maleena, who has been present for all the worries, described her new stepfather succinctly: He makes her happy and hes a good dude.', 'A D.J. provided by Jamies Dream Team played, Because You Loved Me by Celine Dion for the first dance. A particular lyric  You were my strength when I was weak/You were my voice when I couldnt speak  had several onlookers in tears while Ms. Stipkovits and Mr. Garish held each other.']
