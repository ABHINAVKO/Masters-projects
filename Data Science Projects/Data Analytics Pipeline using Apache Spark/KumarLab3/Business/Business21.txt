Good morning. 

A collective response to Russia, a brutal hate crime in France and a mysterious train in Beijing. Here’s the latest:

• Sixty diplomats expelled, the Seattle consulate shut.

The United States joined European allies in kicking out Russian officials over the nerve gas poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil. But President Trump avoided any public condemnation of Russia’s role in the attack.

We examine how an outraged Europe agreed to the hard line against Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. The coordinated response is a win for Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, and a show of unity by NATO allies after a year of fraying ties.

The expulsions were Mr. Trump’s toughest action yet against the Kremlin. In the special investigation into his ties to Russia, Mr. Trump is essentially down to a one-man legal defense team after two newly hired lawyers bowed out.

• “To attack a Jew is to attack France.”

That was French interior minister, Gérard Collomb, condemning the brutal murder in Paris of Mireille Knoll, an 85-year-old Jewish woman who had survived the Holocaust.

A number of anti-Semitic episodes have shaken France, and the speed with which the authorities labeled Ms. Knoll’s killing, in the apartment building above, a hate crime is being seen as a reaction to anger at the official response to the murder last year of another older Jewish woman.

That woman was killed by a man who shouted, “God is great” and threw her out a window. Prosecutors took months to characterize that crime as anti-Semitic.

• President Trump secured his first major trade deal. The U.S. and South Korea agreed to renegotiate their trade pact, with Seoul exempted from tariffs on steel and aluminum in exchange for reducing its steel exports and opening its market to American cars.

The deal, discussed by South Korea’s trade minister, above, looked like early vindication of the White House’s efforts to use the tariffs as a bargaining chip.

Meanwhile, many are wondering if Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s reclusive leader, is in Beijing. The question emerged after a video showed an old-style green train — similar to one previously used by North Korea’s leaders — arriving in the Chinese capital amid high security.

On this day in 1915, Mary Mallon, nicknamed Typhoid Mary, was placed in quarantine for the second time in New York City. Though she never displayed any symptoms of the disease, she would be confined for the rest of her life.

In 1906, health officials tied Ms. Mallon to outbreaks of typhoid fever in seven wealthy families for whom she had worked as a cook.

She was confirmed to be a carrier of the disease and quarantined. Doctors released her in 1910 under the condition that she no longer work as a cook. Shortly after, she disappeared.

Ms. Mallon was rediscovered in 1915 by officials investigating a typhoid outbreak in a Manhattan hospital. She had been working there as a cook under an assumed name.

She was then quarantined for 23 years, until her death in 1938 after a stroke.

During her life, the public was fascinated by Ms. Mallon, above. She often appeared in news stories and cartoons, with one depicting her frying skulls in a pan. She was frustrated by the attention and by her captivity, once describing herself as “a peep show for everybody.”

Her case is often referenced during public health crises, such as the Ebola epidemic, in debates over the power of officials to quarantine people they believe carry diseases.

Good morning. A collective response to Russia, an adult film star’s record ratings, and a mysterious train arrives in Beijing. Here’s what you need to know: 

•  Sixty diplomats expelled, the Seattle consulate shut.

The U.S. joined European allies in kicking out Russian officials over the nerve gas poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil. It’s President Trump’s toughest action yet against the Kremlin. Here’s how this compares with past espionage feuds.

The coordinated response is a win for Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, and a show of unity by NATO allies after a year of fraying ties.

• President Trump has been quiet as two women — a pornographic film star and a Playboy model — have publicly claimed that they had affairs with him, but that doesn’t mean he’s happy about it. (Melania Trump, too, has been silent.)

In a “60 Minutes” interview, the porn actress Stormy Daniels, above, said that she and her daughter were threatened in Las Vegas by a man who told her: “Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.”

The actress said the threat influenced her decision to accept $130,000 for her silence about the alleged affair. She is now suing to get out of that agreement.

(The “60 Minutes” interview drew 22 million viewers, the highest ratings for the program in almost a decade.)

• “An absolute win-win.” 

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin hailed President Trump’s first major trade deal: South Korea won an exemption from U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs by agreeing to import more American cars and reducing its steel exports.

The deal soothed fears, at least for the moment, about a global trade war. A bigger battle looms over Made in China 2025, Beijing’s plan to dominate advanced industries.

_____

• Is Kim Jong-un in Beijing?

The question emerged after a video showed an old-style green train — similar to one used by used by North Korea’s leaders — arriving in the Chinese capital amid high security.

There was no official pronouncement from China or North Korea. But the Japanese broadcaster NTV showed footage of what it said was the train, raising the possibility that a powerful envoy or even Mr. Kim himself may be visiting.

Journalists also spotted a military honor guard welcoming a convoy that entered the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, above, where top North Korean leaders have been known to stay.

SAN FRANCISCO — In 2014, Russians working for a shadowy firm called the Internet Research Agency started gathering American followers in online groups focused on issues like religion and immigration. Around mid-2015, the Russians began buying digital ads to spread their messages. A year later, they tapped their followers to help organize political rallies across the United States.

Their digital instrument of choice for all of these actions? Facebook and its photo-sharing site Instagram.

The social network, more than any other technology tool, was singled out on Friday by the Justice Department when prosecutors charged 13 Russians and three companies for executing a scheme to subvert the 2016 election and support Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign. In a 37-page indictment, officials detailed how the Russians repeatedly turned to Facebook and Instagram, often using stolen identities to pose as Americans, to sow discord among the electorate by creating Facebook groups, distributing divisive ads and posting inflammatory images.

While the indictment does not accuse Facebook of any wrongdoing, it provided the first comprehensive account from the authorities of how critical the company’s platforms had been to the Russian campaign to disrupt the 2016 election. Facebook and Instagram were mentioned 41 times, while other technology that the Russians used was featured far less. Twitter was referred to nine times, YouTube once and the electronic payments company PayPal 11 times.

It is unprecedented for an American technology company to be so central to what the authorities say was a foreign scheme to commit election fraud in the United States. The indictment further batters Facebook’s image after it has spent months grappling with questions about how it was misused and why it did not act earlier to prevent that activity.

Jonathan Albright, research director at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism, said the indictment laid bare how effectively Facebook could be turned against the country.

“Facebook built incredibly effective tools which let Russia profile citizens here in the U.S. and figure out how to manipulate us,” Mr. Albright said. “Facebook, essentially, gave them everything they needed.” He added that many of the tools that the Russians used, including those that allow ads to be targeted and that show how widespread an ad becomes, still pervade Facebook.

Facebook, with more than two billion members on the social network alone, has long struggled with what its sites show and the kind of illicit activity it may enable, from selling unlicensed guns to broadcasting live killings. The company’s business depends on people being highly engaged with what is posted on its sites, which in turn helps make it a marquee destination for advertisers.

When suggestions first arose after the 2016 election that Facebook may have influenced the outcome, Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, dismissed the concerns. But by last September, Facebook had disclosed  that the Internet Research Agency had bought divisive ads on hot-button issues through the company. It later said 150 million Americans had seen the Russian propaganda on the social network and Instagram.

The resulting firestorm has damaged Facebook’s reputation. Company officials, along with executives from Google and YouTube, were grilled by lawmakers last fall. Facebook has since hired thousands of people to help monitor content and has worked with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation into Russian election interference. It has also changed its advertising policy so that any ad that mentions a candidate’s name goes through a more stringent vetting process. Mr. Zuckerberg has vowed to not let Facebook be abused by bad actors.

Yet Facebook’s multiple mentions in Friday’s indictment renew questions of why the world’s biggest social media company didn’t catch the Russian activity earlier or do more to stop it. How effective the company’s new efforts to reduce foreign manipulation have been is also unclear.

Rob Goldman, Facebook’s vice president of advertising, waded into the discussion on Friday with a series of tweets that argued that Russia’s goal was to sow chaos among the electorate rather than to force a certain outcome in the election. On Saturday, President Trump cited those tweets as evidence that Russia’s disinformation campaign was not aimed at handing him a victory.

In Silicon Valley, where Facebook has its headquarters, some critics pilloried the company after the indictment became public.

“Mueller’s indictment underscores the central role of Facebook and other platforms in the Russian interference in 2016,” said Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who had invested early in Facebook. “In its heyday, television brought the country together, giving viewers a shared set of facts and experiences. Facebook does just the opposite, enabling every user to have a unique set of facts, driving the country apart for profit.”

Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president of global policy, said in a statement that the company was grateful the government was taking action “against those who abused our service and exploited the openness of our democratic process.”

He added that Facebook was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ahead of this year’s midterm elections to ensure that a similar manipulation campaign would not take place. “We know we have more to do to prevent against future attacks,” he said.

Facebook has previously questioned whether law enforcement should be more involved in helping to stop the threat from nation state actors. Facebook said it worked closely with the special counsel’s investigation.

YouTube did not respond to a request for comment, while Twitter declined to comment. PayPal said in a statement that it has worked closely with law enforcement and “is intensely focused on combating and preventing the illicit use of our services.”

According to the indictment, the Internet Research Agency, created in 2014 in St. Petersburg and employing about 80 people, was given the job of interfering with elections and political processes.

The group began using American social media to achieve those aims in 2014, when it started making Facebook pages dedicated to social issues like race and religion. Over the next two years, the indictment said, the Russians stole the identities of real Americans to create fake personas and fake accounts on social media. The group then used those to populate and promote Facebook pages like United Muslims of America, Blacktivist and Secured Borders.

By 2016, the indictment said, the size of some of these Russian-controlled Facebook groups had ballooned to hundreds of thousands of followers.

The Russians then used these groups to push various messages, including telling Americans not to vote in the 2016 election for either Mr. Trump or his opponent, Hillary Clinton. In October 2016, according to the indictment, one Russian-controlled Instagram account called Woke Blacks posted a message saying: “Hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we’d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.”

Around 2015, according to the indictment, the Russians also started purchasing ads on Facebook and other social media sites like Twitter, targeting specific communities within the United States. The group used stolen PayPal accounts to pay for the ads and to promote posts, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the outreach.

In one ad, published to promote a Facebook event called “Down with Hillary,” an image of Mrs. Clinton was shown with a black “X” painted across her face. The text read, “Hillary Clinton is the co-author of Obama’s anti-police and anti-Constitutional propaganda.”

By mid-2016, according to the indictment, the Russians were using their fake Facebook personas to organize political rallies in the United States. That June, for example, posing as the United Muslims of America on Facebook, they promoted a rally called “Support Hillary. Save American Muslims.” For an August 2016 event organized through Facebook, the Russians also paid for a cage to be built that was large enough to hold an actress depicting Mrs. Clinton in a prison uniform.

At every step, the Russians used Facebook’s own tools to make sure their propaganda was as effective as possible. Those tools allowed them to get real-time results on which types of ad campaigns were reaching their target audience or which posts were getting the most engagement with viewers.

Researchers said that those tools are still widely available and that while the company has worked to remove fake accounts and stem the flow of disinformation, it has refused to let outside researchers examine the data on how Russian actors used the platform so effectively.

“They’re taking steps to fix this, but there’s no easy solution,” Anton Vuljaj, a Republican media strategist who has advised campaigns and media groups, said of Facebook and other social media companies. “This also shows that the public needs to be more vigilant about what is real and what is not online.”

Good morning.

President Trump’s tariff salvo, fewer weapons inside Ukraine’s Parliament and a pile of ocean garbage larger than France. Here’s what you need to know:

• The Trump administration said it would exempt the European Union and other allies from stiff steel and aluminum tariffs that go into effect today, but in a twist, the administration may impose import quotas to prevent too much foreign metal from flooding into the United States.

The move came as President Trump announced plans to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports, in punishment for what the White House says is China’s pattern of co-opting American tech and trade secrets.

China hit back Friday morning, proposing reciprocal tariffs on $3 billion of American-made imports, and said that it would also pursue legal action against the U.S. at the World Trade Organization.

Separately, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, will be replaced by John R. Bolton, a hard-line former U.S. ambassador who supported Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U.

• “This is a message for Monsieur Macron.”

Travel was upended, schools were closed and tens of thousands of people took to the streets across France on Thursday as railway workers, teachers, students and air traffic controllers went on strike to protest President Emmanuel Macron’s economic and social reforms.

But the anger on the streets has found little expression in France’s legislature, where Mr. Macron has been given free rein to ram through major legislation.

• “The most important thing is that we fix this system.”

Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, gave an unexpected interview to two of our reporters about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

Not everyone was impressed by Mr. Zuckerberg’s statements, days after we broke the story that data from over 50 million profiles had been secretly scraped. “He avoided the big issue,” an analyst said, “which is that for many years, Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy.”

On “The Daily” podcast, one of the reporters who interviewed Mr. Zuckerberg described how it went. (Facebook’s outreach was so sudden, they had to ask him to hold the line while they read his just-posted public statement.)

On this day in 1839, The Boston Morning Post published “O.K.” for the first known time, using the abbreviation next to the words “all correct.” (It’s not written “okay,” The Times stylebook says.)

There have been many theories about its origin, but the most likely is that O.K. was an abbreviation for the deliberately misspelled “orl korrect” (all correct), and the expression gained prominence in the mid-19th century.

Allen Walker Read, a longtime English professor at Columbia University, debunked some theories in the 1960s, including that the term had come from Andrew Jackson’s poor spelling, a Native American word or an Army biscuit.

Today, O.K. is “an Americanism adopted by virtually every language, and one of the first words spoken on the moon,” the Times obituary of Mr. Read noted in 2002.

The professor didn’t “appreciate having ‘O.K.’ overshadow the hundreds of other etymologies he divined,” it continued. He also tracked early uses of Dixie, Podunk and the “almighty dollar.”

In the 1920s, Mr. Read hitchhiked through western Iowa hunting down the word “blizzard.”

“A man called Lightnin’ Ellis had first used the word for a snowstorm in 1870,” he learned. “Within 10 years, it had spread throughout the Midwest.”

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Mark Zuckerberg, the social media giant’s chief executive, publicly addressed the crisis facing his company, five days after reports about the misuse of data from 50 million of its users.

“We also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it,” he wrote in a statement outlining the steps Facebook would take to better protect users’ information. He also spoke to The Times about his plans for change.

Given that the gathering of user data is fundamental to the company’s operations, lawmakers and researchers were unimpressed by Mr. Zuckerberg’s mea culpa: “He avoided the big issue, which is that for many years, Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy,” a Columbia University researcher said.

• Disillusioned Facebook users  have been leaving the service. Want to delete your account? You can try.

• A pair of pink construction gloves led to Mark Anthony Conditt, who the police say was responsible for a string of bombings in the Texas capital.

On Wednesday, Mr. Conditt, a 23-year-old from the Austin suburbs with no criminal record, detonated one of his homemade devices and killed himself before he could be apprehended. Here’s what we know about him.

• The authorities are now trying to determine a motive. They’re being helped by a 25-minute confession the suspect left on his phone.

• President Trump has said the country is an “economic enemy” of the U.S. that has “taken advantage of us like nobody in history.”

Today, he plans to announce tariffs on at least $50 billion of annual Chinese imports and to impose other penalties in response to the theft of technology and trade secrets. Previously announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which will also affect China, go into effect on Friday.

China’s staggering economic growth has indeed been propelled by unfair trade practices, but experts worry that the president’s go-it-alone approach undermines the potential for collective action.

• On Wednesday, Mr. Trump appeared to endorse a $1.3 trillion spending deal reached by Congress. Lawmakers must approve the bill by midnight Friday to avoid a government shutdown.

• President’s Trump’s lead lawyer for the special counsel investigation resigned today, according to two people briefed on the matter.

The lawyer, John Dowd, who took over the president’s legal team last summer, had considered leaving several times and ultimately concluded that Mr. Trump was increasingly ignoring his advice, one of the people said.

• The president has said that he would agree to an interview with the office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, but Mr. Dowd has said that was a bad idea.

• At the request of Congress, the bureau investigated Attorney General Jeff Sessions for possible perjury last year, after he inaccurately said that he had no contacts with Russians during the presidential campaign, according to three people familiar with the case.

Andrew McCabe, the F.B.I.’s deputy director at the time, was said to have authorized the inquiry. Mr. McCabe was recently fired — by Mr. Sessions — for showing “lack of candor” in an internal investigation.

• Separately, John Brennan, a former C.I.A. director and a pointed critic of President Trump, said that he thought Russia may have compromising information on the president. He later said that his opinion wasn’t based on inside knowledge.

• Can the Federal Reserve engineer the best economy since the 1960s? Its new chairman, Jerome Powell, is going to try.

The central bank raised interest rates on Wednesday and said it expected to do so twice more this year.

• Time magazine, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money  are up for sale.

• The April 17 deadline for filing taxes  is fast approaching, and many virtual currency traders are sweating over their returns.

• U.S. stocks were down on Wednesday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today.

• Where do birds flock together? 

Australians are mailing feathers to help find out.

A scientist asked people to send her fallen feathers, like the ones shown below, so that she could map bird movements as the country’s wetlands disappear.

•  In praise of Grandma

When we introduced the Overlooked project two weeks ago, we asked readers to suggest people they felt deserved, but didn’t get, obituaries in The Times.

We’ve received close to 2,500 submissions. About 30 were from readers who told us about their grandmothers or great-grandmothers, who often fought strong institutional prejudice. Here are their stories.

• The Boss remains on Broadway

Bruce Springsteen’s sold-out show, “Springsteen on Broadway,” has been extended until December.

The average ticket price last week was a whopping $507.60. (By comparison, the average price for “The Lion King” was $149.27.)

• The Times, in other words

Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles.

On this day in 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Eisenstadt v. Baird that it’s unconstitutional for a state to deny unmarried people access to contraception.

The court had ruled earlier, in 1965, that state bans on contraceptives for married couples violated their privacy rights. But a few states still restricted access for single people.

Bill Baird, an activist, violated one such law in Massachusetts. He appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court, which struck down the law.

Justice William Brennan held that the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because it discriminated between married and unmarried people.

The case became an important precedent for landmark rulings by the Supreme Court, including the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that recognized abortion rights, and, more recently, the 2015 decision guaranteeing a right to same-sex marriage.

A movie about Mr. Baird’s case is in development.

Mr. Baird has continued working as an activist, but his legacy is complicated by what The Times described in 1993 as an “unapologetic zealotry” and a willingness to criticize “even his ideologic allies.” Planned Parenthood once called him an “embarrassment.”

Good morning. 

Australia dodges U.S. tariffs, prominent septuagenarians trade schoolyard taunts, and the great Pacific garbage patch may now be the size of Mongolia. Here’s what you need to know: 

• Australia and South Korea made the list of American allies that will be spared, for now, from steep U.S. tariffs on aluminum and steel that go into effect today. Above, a steel mill in Wollongong, south of Sydney.

The U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, also said Argentina, Brazil and the European Union would join Canada and Mexico as exempt, at least temporarily.

Those countries accounted for more than half of the total volume of steel sold to the U.S. in 2017, so the exemptions could undercut the tariffs’ impact on domestic steel mills.

• Banishing any possible doubt about the focus of his sweeping tariffs, President Trump announced plans to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports and to exact other penalties from an “economic enemy.”

Some 1,300 lines of goods to be affected are to be named within 15 days.

Mr. Lighthizer, the trade representative, said he was pushing to target products from the advanced industries in Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” plan, including electric vehicles, high-tech shipping and aerospace technology.

Our Beijing correspondent looks at the challenges China’s president, Xi Jinping, must now confront.

President Trump’s national security adviser is out. H. R. McMaster, will be replaced by John R. Bolton, a hard-line former U.S. ambassador.

• Before the massacre. 

Using exclusively obtained surveillance footage, we pieced together the last days of Stephen Paddock, the gunman who rained lethal fire on a music festival in Las Vegas last October, killing scores.

He plays video poker, laughs with hotel staff — and hauls bag after bag of weapons into his suite.

• “The most important thing is that we fix this system.” 

Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, gave an unexpected interview to two of our reporters about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

Not everyone was impressed by Mr. Zuckerberg’s statements, days after we broke the story that data from over 50 million profiles had been secretly scraped. “He avoided the big issue,” an analyst said, “which is that for many years, Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy.”

On “The Daily” podcast, one of the reporters who interviewed Mr. Zuckerberg described how it went. (Facebook’s outreach was so sudden, they had to ask him to hold the line while they read his just-posted public statement.)

_____

• Septuagenarian schoolyard taunts.

Joe Biden started it. T he former vice president — who may be considering a 2020 challenge for the presidency — said that if he were younger (he’s 75), he would “beat the hell” out of President Trump for disrespecting women.

Mr. Trump, 71, countered that Mr. Biden “would go down fast and hard” if the two brawled.

Separately, Mr. Trump’s lead lawyer for the special counsel investigation resigned after concluding that his advice was being ignored.

• The Australia newsletter.

This week’s edition asks: Where is integration working in the country, and where is it failing? (A big inspiration for the piece was an Uber driver who turned out to hold a Ph.D. in literature.)

And many of you connected with the reflection on Nippers in our last newsletter. Here are some of your responses on why you love — or hate — the lifesaving surf program for kids.

• “Make happy those who are near and those who are far will come”: Peggy and Andrew Cherng spent 45 years building Panda Express into a restaurant empire with more than $3 billion in sales last year.

• Tencent Holdings, Asia’s most valuable company, lost more than $26 billion of market capitalization after it warned that it would be reducing spending on content and technology to pursue sustained growth.

• Citigroup is setting restrictions on the sale of firearms by business customers, making it the first Wall Street bank to take a stance in the divisive U.S. gun control debate.

 • Time magazine, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money are up for sale.

• U.S. stocks were weaker. Here’s a snapshot of global markets.

• The great Pacific garbage patch contains at least 79,000 tons of material spread over 1.6 million square kilometers, according to a new study. That’s about the size of Mongolia or Iran, and as much as 16 times larger than past estimates. [Science News]

• The Queensland police confirmed that two Americans died in a helicopter crash off the Great Barrier Reef on Wednesday. [The New York Times]

• A Perth department store  was accused of racial profiling after staff members called security on an Indigenous teenager shopping with his father. [ABC]

• “Dead to me.” The immigration minister Peter Dutton denounced the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and The Guardian after they criticized his plan to fast-track visas for white South African farmers. [The Guardian]

• The ashes of Stephen Hawking, the renowned cosmologist, will be interred next to the grave of Sir Isaac Newton at Westminster Abbey. [The New York Times]

• Honey Popcorn, a K-pop group made up of Japanese adult video actresses, released its debut mini-album, “Bibidi Babidi Boo.” (Watch the video.) The backlash in South Korea has been intense. [Yonhap]

Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.

• Recipe of the day: End the week with the perfect snack: chips and creamy queso.

• Considering a “green” funeral? Here’s what you need to know.

• Encourage great hotel service by following these tips.

• The Juneau, a long-lost Navy cruiser blasted apart by a Japanese torpedo in World War II, was discovered off the coast of the Solomon Islands by a team funded by the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul Allen. Among the hundreds of dead were five brothers from one Iowa family.

• In praise of Grandma. As the Overlooked project started, we asked readers to suggest women they felt deserved, but didn’t get, obituaries in The Times. Here are the stories you told us about your grandmothers and great-grandmothers.

• And a team of scientists spend time in the streets of Tokyo and the shark-filled waters of Asia in “The Rising Sea,” a thriller by Clive Cussler and Graham Brown that’s No. 1 on our hardcover fiction and combined print and e-book fiction lists.

It’s a shortcut used the world over — and even beyond, having been uttered at least once during a space mission.

On this day in 1839, The Boston Morning Post published “O.K.” for the first known time, using the abbreviation next to the words “all correct.” (It’s not written “okay,” The Times stylebook says.)

There have been many theories about its origin, but the most likely is that O.K. was  an abbreviation for the deliberately misspelled “orl korrect” (all correct), and the expression gained prominence in the mid-19th century.

Allen Walker Read, a longtime English professor at Columbia University, debunked some theories in the 1960s, including that the term had come from Andrew Jackson’s poor spelling, a Native American word or an Army biscuit.

Today, O.K. is “an Americanism adopted by virtually every language, and one of the first words spoken on the moon,” the Times obituary of Mr. Read noted in 2002.

The professor didn’t “appreciate having ‘O.K.’ overshadow the hundreds of other etymologies he divined,” it continued. He also tracked early uses of Dixie, Podunk and the “almighty dollar.”

In the 1920s, Mr. Read hitchhiked through western Iowa hunting down the word blizzard.

“A man called Lightnin’ Ellis had first used the word for a snowstorm in 1870,” he learned. “Within 10 years, it had spread throughout the Midwest.”

Good morning. 

Boris Johnson’s Hitler comment, Mark Zuckerberg’s admission and Emmanuel Macron’s big challenge. Here’s what you need to know:

• Tensions between Britain and Russia hit a new peak.

Boris Johnson, the top British diplomat, told Parliament that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, would use the World Cup this summer as a propaganda tool, much as Hitler did with the 1936 Olympic Games.

In Moscow, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned foreign diplomats to suggest Britain itself may have been responsible for poisoning a former Russian double agent and his daughter with a nerve agent. (The British ambassador did not attend.)

Separately, European leaders are expected to approve a deal today to avoid a sudden change of trade rules when Britain quits the European Union next March. But Brexit supporters are angry about policy retreats from London.

• President Trump plans today to announce at least $50 billion worth of annual tariffs and other penalties against China for its theft of technology and trade secrets, which administration officials say has robbed American companies of billions of dollars in revenue and killed thousands of jobs. Above, Mr. Trump led a delegation of top U.S. companies to China last year.

The measures represent Mr. Trump’s most aggressive move yet against a fast-rising economic rival that he has accused of preying on the United States.

Mr. Trump also defended his decision to congratulate Mr. Putin on his re-election, and he lashed out at the news media for reporting that he had disregarded the advice of his national security team in doing so.

• “We also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it.”

Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, broke his silence on the growing furor over reports that outside companies harvested data from 50 million accounts.

He said Facebook would crack down on outside apps and bolster privacy. The company has lost about $50 billion in market value since the reports were published, and growing numbers of users are considering deleting their accounts. British officials investigating fake news say Mr. Zuckerberg misled them and have summoned him for an explanation.

On “The Daily,” we talk to one of our reporters who broke the story and discuss how a key data scientist at Cambridge Analytica, one of the companies involved, became a whistle-blower.

• A proposal by President Emmanuel Macron to erase the special status — and cut the generous benefits — of French railway workers has created a new and formidable challenge to his campaign to reshape France: strikes.

A wave of nationwide walkouts by public sector workers, the first since Mr. Macron took office, begins today. Trains, planes and schools will be affected, and how he responds will be a signal of his resolve.

• The European authorities proposed revamping how digital businesses in the region are taxed, outlining broad changes that they hope will curb tax avoidance across the bloc. Above, Google’s headquarters in Dublin.

• The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. Under a new chairman, Jerome Powell, it signaled two more increases this year.

• Swiss prosecutors began an investigation into the French luxury group Kering, owner of Gucci and Saint Laurent, widening the legal scrutiny of its tax practices in Europe.

• One of Turkey’s leading media groups was sold to an ally of the country’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a move widely seen as likely to further limit the independence of the Turkish news media.

• Our technology reporter in Mumbai explains how cheap mobile data is changing India, and why WhatsApp is indispensable.

•  Here’s a snapshot of global markets.

• Israel confirmed it had destroyed a Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007, breaking years of secrecy as tensions mount over Iran’s nuclear ambitions. (Israel released the above image yesterday.) [The New York Times]

• The ashes of Stephen Hawking, the renowned cosmologist, will be interred next to the grave of Sir Isaac Newton at Westminster Abbey. [The New York Times]

 • In the U.S., a portrait emerged of the bomber who terrorized Austin, Tex., hours after he blew himself up. The police say they found his video confession. [The New York Times]

• More than 20 people were at the table for President Trump’s meeting with the Saudi crown prince. None were women. [The New York Times]

• Bird populations across the French countryside have collapsed by a third over the last 15 years, and scientists say pesticides are to blame. “The situation is catastrophic,” a researcher said. [The Guardian]

• Former  President Nicolas Sarkozy of France faces corruption charges in connection with his 2007 election campaign, which is alleged to have received illegal financial support from the Libyan government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. [The New York Times]

• Kosovo’s Parliament ratified a border agreement with Montenegro, though opposition lawmakers tried to stop the proceedings by releasing tear gas. [Reuters]

Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.

• Recipe of the day: Brighten up the usual salmon dinner with a sauce of capers, scallions, parsley and garlic.

• Thinking of going to Brazil? You’ll need this vaccination.

• Here’s how to protect your data on Facebook.

• Nepal wants to remove 200,000 pounds of trekkers’ garbage in a campaign aimed at “saving the glory of the Everest region.” (They’re going to need more yaks.)

• In Germany, a growing number of art museums offer tours for dementia patients, designed to bring stimulation and solace.

•  A scientist in Australia asked people across the country to mail her fallen feathers, like the ones shown above, so she could map bird movements as the country’s wetlands disappear. The response, she says, has been “really exciting.”

On this day in 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Eisenstadt v. Baird that it’s unconstitutional for a state to deny unmarried people access to contraception.

The court  ruled in 1965 that state bans on contraceptives for married couples violated their privacy rights. But a few states still restricted access for single people.
