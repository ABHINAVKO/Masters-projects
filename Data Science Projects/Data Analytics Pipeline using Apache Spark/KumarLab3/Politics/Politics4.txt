SAN FRANCISCO Â In a city where being called conservative can be an insult and where partisanship is often left versus further left, the removal of an African-American interim mayor, and her replacement by a white, male venture capitalist, was bound to set off an uproar.

The appointment of Mark Farrell, the venture capitalist, and the ouster of London Breed, the interim mayor, by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors on Tuesday in some ways exemplified a larger battle for the soul of San Francisco. In just seven years the median price of a home here has nearly doubled, to $1.3 million Â a transformation, driven by the riches of the tech industry, that continues to push out longtime residents, many of them nonwhites.

But what may seem on the surface to be a familiar clash between tech and those threatened by its rise is in fact a moment full of complicated alliances and seeming contradictions.

Mr. Farrell, who is the managing director of Thayer Ventures, a firm that invests in technology companies, was backed by a faction that has been critical of tech companiesÂ influence on San Francisco.

Ms. Breed rose up from modest means and has vociferous support among the cityÂs thinning African-American population. But she also had the backing of a prominent Silicon Valley investor, Ron Conway.

The political fight quickly spilled out of the wood-paneled meeting rooms of City Hall and into the public arena. It will culminate in a mayoral election in June, one that promises to be in part a battle over the influence of the tech industry on the city and its politics.

ÂThere have been many local politicians who say the tech industry is different, that they are innovative, they want to disrupt the status quo Â maybe thatÂs true on some levels,Â said Hillary Ronen, a member of the Board of Supervisors who voted to remove Ms. Breed on Tuesday. ÂBut I havenÂt seen that big of a difference when it comes to their interest and their willingness to attack politicians who donÂt put their interests first and foremost.Â

Perhaps no single person has emerged as the face of the tech industryÂs political influence as has Mr. Conway, an investor who made a fortune taking early stakes in companies including Airbnb and Pinterest. Mr. Conway, an adviser to former Mayor Edwin Lee, whose death from a heart attack in December prompted the political scramble to replace him, has been a behind-the-scenes promoter of Ms. BreedÂs candidacy.

Yet amid the debate over the tech industryÂs influence, there was the powerful imagery of a black woman being thrown out of office, albeit an interim one, in a city that has a long history of discrimination against blacks.

On Tuesday evening, when Mr. Farrell was appointed by a 6-3 vote, some members of the public howled in derision, including many African-American supporters of Ms. Breed.

ÂThe black community is not going to take this sitting down,Â the Rev. Amos Brown, head of the N.A.A.C.P. in San Francisco and the pastor of Third Baptist Church, said in an interview on Wednesday.

Mr. Brown portrayed the decision as yet another blow to blacks in the city, whose numbers have been dwindling in recent years and who were evicted en masse during the city-led redevelopment of black neighborhoods in the 1960s and Â70s. ÂThereÂs never been an intentional effort on the so-called progressive liberals of this town to work with the black community so that we would have our fair share,Â he said.

In a measure of the complex racial dynamics in San Francisco, Mr. Brown said Asians had been welcomed at the expense of blacks. ÂThey opened the floodgates to Southeast Asians and to China, but they told black folks to get out of the way,Â he said.

Ms. Breed, in an interview, played down the racial component of her ouster.

ÂI prefer not to get into the thoughts around that,Â Ms. Breed said. ÂItÂs unfortunate that this has brought out the worst in some people.Â

Asked about the attacks on Mr. Conway and his support for her, Ms. Breed said she saw it as a political tactic.

ÂThis is the playbook of these people in order to gain power and win elections,Â she said. ÂThey have to point the finger at someone. TheyÂve got to say that someone is the big, bad boogeyman.Â

The group that ousted Ms. Breed as interim mayor said their motivation was to avoid a conflict of interest. Ms. Breed, who in the lingo of San Francisco liberal politics is described as a moderate, is president of the Board of Supervisors. Holding both that position and being interim mayor gave her unchecked authority and what her ousters said was an unfair power of incumbency. Mr. Farrell is not running for mayor.

The June election has particularly high stakes. The winner is eligible to serve the balance of Mr. LeeÂs term, then run twice more, potentially securing the mayorÂs office for the next decade.

Some analysts see Ms. BreedÂs removal as a cold political calculus by the cityÂs progressive faction: Removing her from office would give them a better shot at reclaiming the mayorÂs office in June. One of the supervisors who voted for Mr. Farrell on Tuesday is Jane Kim, a progressive who is running for mayor. With no clear front-runner yet, the election is a chance for the cityÂs progressive wing to reclaim an office that they have been locked out of since the 1980s.

Ms. Breed Â who supports legalizing marijuana and recently wrote an op-ed on the need for cities to divest from fossil fuel companies Â is considered right of the San Francisco center for her corporate ties and perceived receptiveness to the tech industry.

Mr. Farrell is also considered a moderate and is perhaps best known for a taking a tougher approach toward the cityÂs homeless problem, sponsoring a ballot measure that banned tent encampments from sidewalks. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

But some are skeptical that ideology played a large part in this weekÂs political machinations.

ÂThey said they didnÂt want a white rich person in charge and then they put a rich white person in charge,Â said Peter Ragone, a Democratic political consultant in San Francisco who was the communications director for a former mayor, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. ÂWhat IÂve learned over the years in San Francisco is that for progressives it is not about conscience or ideology, itÂs about power.Â

ÂA congressman walks into a bar ...Â

Alcohol Â perhaps more than any product Â has been a perennial target of regulation and a source of public revenue. It has inspired our governmentÂs first tax, subsequent rebellions, consumer product regulations and unrestrained effort at eradicating it as an industry.

Join us for an event at Wigle Whiskey, PittsburghÂs first distillery after Prohibition, to learn some of the historical highlights of the wild historical booze ride in the United States Â and to examine what the future holds for drinking in Pennsylvania and across the country.

Clay Risen, a spirits expert and the deputy Op-Ed editor at The New York Times, will moderate the discussion with Meredith Meyer Grelli, a co-founder of Wigle Whiskey and Threadbare Cider and Mead; Leslie A. Przybylek, the senior curator at the Senator John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh; and Paul Costa, a Pennsylvania state representative and the Democratic chairman of the House Liquor Control Committee.

STICKY FINGERS The Life and Times of Jann Wenner and Rolling Stone Magazine By Joe Hagan Illustrated. 560 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $29.95.

Joe Hagan paints the rogueÂs life of the Rolling Stone co-founder Jann Wenner with a brush made of stinging nettles, rasping the famed editorÂs reputation on nearly every page. Wenner betrays. Wenner lies. Wenner cheats. He reneges on promises. He sucks up to stars, letting them approve copy in his magazine. Stealing a book-editing credit from an underling, he justifies it as Âa Âdroit du seigneurÂ thing.Â

ÂHe leads with his appetites Â I take, I see, I have,Â says Art Garfunkel, who knows him well, capturing the mogulÂs method in a tidy tricolon. ÂI donÂt know how he does it, but I think heÂs pretty much immune to guilt,Â adds Tom Wolfe, who thrived under his direction in the 1970s and Â80s.

Indictments like these would shatter an ordinary man into crushed stone. But WennerÂs narcissistic and violent temperament, on high boil since early youth and on full display in this survey of his life, has made him impervious to outside judgment. HeÂs one part Sammy Glick, using and discarding people on his race to the top. HeÂs a shot of Richard III, cruel and controlling. And heÂs a lot like Mr. Toad, singing self-praise at every available turn. But donÂt worry: The bookÂs cutting assessment wonÂt cause him any more pain than a brisk, full-body dermabrasion.

Hagan comes to bury his real-life antihero. Given the critical material Â seven decadesÂ worth Â he has to. But Hagan also lavishes praise upon Wenner for building a media empire from a tiny grubstake. That Wenner has been liquidating his empire Â Rolling Stone was put up for sale as ÂSticky FingersÂ went to press Â only makes the story more urgent. When they build a pantheon of scamps-turned-great publishers, a plaster bust of Wenner will stand next to the men whose careers inspired him: Hugh Hefner, Henry Luce and William Randolph Hearst.

Born in 1946 during the opening hours of the baby boom (his first pediatrician was Dr. Benjamin Spock), the young Wenner was Âshort and pudgy, with a prickly intelligence and a bracing self-confidence.Â He was also a bad person, according to the early assessments. ÂA pain in the ass,Â his father said. ÂHe can be, and frequently is, extremely cruel to his classmates,Â one boarding school teacher reported. Wenner claims that following their divorce, his mother and father Âfought over not who got to keep Jan Simon Wenner but who had to take him.Â He even swears his bohemian mother once called him Âthe worst child she had ever met.Â

No surprise, then, that WennerÂs pushy press mogul persona surfaced in his youth. At the age of 11, he joined two neighborhood kids who had started a mimeographed newspaper and shoved his way to the editor in chief position. Later, when his broken family abandoned him to a Southern California boarding school overstocked with the offspring of celebrities (Jack Benny, Yul Brynner, Judy Garland et al.), he used the school yearbook and the underground newspaper he founded (The Sardine) to climb the social ladder. The ability and willingness to ingratiate himself to others would prove indispensable into adulthood as he charmed new investors or flattered rockers, movie stars, politicians and the wealthy to appear in his pages.

Studying at Berkeley, Wenner collected the other seeds that would sprout into Rolling Stone. Devoted to LSD, he became the campus newspaperÂs drugs and rock correspondent, plunging into the Merry Pranksters scene Tom Wolfe describes in ÂThe Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.Â He adopted the experienced jazz writer Ralph J. Gleason as his mentor, and eventually co-founded Rolling Stone with him. A visit to the London offices of Melody Maker added to his growing vision: Here was a serious newsroom filled with professionals covering music, not a grubby underground paper produced by a commune. He saw. He wanted. He would make.

New publications have a way of rising from the ruins of others. Rolling Stone owes much to The Sunday Ramparts, the short-lived biweekly paper spun off from Warren HinckleÂs Ramparts magazine. Wenner, who joined the staff in 1966 to cover culture, lifted its graceful design after it folded in 1967. Fusing all he had observed about the trade press, fan rags, criticism and feature writing into one, and drawing on competing underground journals like Crawdaddy! and Mojo Navigator, he created Rolling Stone on a shoestring. ÂItÂs just so good,Â Wenner wept as the first copy rolled off the press.

Until Rolling Stone appeared, young readers had been either dismissed or ignored by existing media. Graybeards will tell you that those early pages were almost a cultural revelation, exciting them to the potential of print the way the web would stimulate a future generation. Hagan reckons that Âfrom 1971 to 1977, Jann Wenner was the most important magazine editor in America.Â Who can disagree? (Disclosures: Three decades ago, Rolling Stone paid me a kill fee for an assignment I botched. Hagan is a casual acquaintance with whom IÂve made small talk on Twitter. About five years ago we talked briefly about his Wenner project and other topics over coffee.)

Hagan, whom Wenner personally asked to write his biography over lunch in 2013, swings the biographerÂs baton with authority, telling Rolling StoneÂs story while capturing Wenner in all his ragged glory. ÂHe was an antiwar liberal and a rapacious capitalist, naÃ¯ve and crafty, friend and enemy, straight and gay, editor and publisher,Â Hagan writes. ÂSticky FingersÂ excels in conveying the complexity of the most intimate and least covered part of WennerÂs life: his sexuality. WennerÂs homosexual drive, first expressed in Âambiguous horseplayÂ that got him arrested at the age of 12, was not fulfilled in what he considered a full-fledged ÂromanceÂ until 1967, when he was 21. He remained on the down-low for the better part of 30 years, fearing he would be outed. His wife, the elegant and alluring Jane Schindelheim Â they met while she was a receptionist at Sunday Ramparts and her family became a founding investor in his magazine Â responded to his affairs with her own. ÂShe didnÂt make me feel guilty; she let me off the hook every single time,Â Wenner tells Hagan.

Wenner officially came out in 1995, leaving Jane for a man with whom he eventually made a family. A tincture of WennerÂs gayish sensibility was always on display in the magazine if you looked for it. The Cockettes drag troupe got early, sympathetic coverage in 1971 and, as Wenner has long acknowledged, the come-hither photographs of androgynous performers like Mick Jagger werenÂt exclusively for the ladies. ÂThat was very gay,Â Wenner now concedes of a 1973 illustration of the Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz, imagining him as a Vargas boy. The same goes for the glimpse of David CassidyÂs pubic hair in a shot by Rolling Stone stalwart Annie Leibovitz, published in 1972. In the afterword, Hagan writes that Wenner gave him free rein but asked for the chance to review the Âmost deeply personal matters Â namely, his sex life.Â Wenner turns out to be no censor. The book teems with his endless pairings and hints at threesomes. One blushes imagining what Wenner asked to be deleted.

ÂSticky FingersÂ makes excellent use of the dozens of hours of interviews Wenner gave him along with 500 boxes of notes, pictures, postcards, recordings, correspondence and other material Wenner started saving at an early age in anticipation of this very biography. Wenner so treasured these archives that he stored them in a vault for safekeeping during the Three Mile Island meltdown. Hagan never locates WennerÂs Rosebud in the hoard, but comes ever so close to writing his ÂCitizen Kane.Â
