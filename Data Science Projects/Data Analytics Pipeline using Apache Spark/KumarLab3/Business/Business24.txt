Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching:

• Facebook calms concerns about ad revenue.

• Stocks briefly dipped into the red on hawkish Fed.

• Could General Electric be dropped from the Dow?

• The C.F.P.B. setup is constitutional.

• Boeing is powering the Dow again.

Shares of the social media giant fell more than 4 percent after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations.

The reason? The cost of fixing Facebook. To address mounting criticism, Facebook has introduced sweeping changes to the kinds of posts, videos and photos that its more than two billion members will see most often.

Of those changes, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said in the companies earnings release:

That’s an important metric for demanding higher ad rates.

But an hour after its results hit the tape, the stock rebounded and then turned positive.

What soothed investors’ concerns? Facebook said on its call with analysts that the average price per ad increased 43 percent in the quarter.

“The impact it has on monetization is certainly not clearly negative,” Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, told analysts.

The stock is up 1.5 percent after hours.

The social media giant reported its fourth-quarter operating profit jumped 61 percent to $7.35 billion after the close Wednesday.

The numbers:

$4.27 billion— The company’s profit for the quarter, including a $3.19 billion tax charge.

$12.97 billion — Facebook’s revenue for the quarter, up 47 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.

1.4 billion — The number of daily active users, up from 1.37 billion in the third quarter.

DealBook’s take:

Digging deeper, there were several impressive numbers in Facebook’s earnings. Its operating profits as a percentage of revenue, or operating margin, ballooned in the fourth quarter to 57 percent, up from 52 percent in the same period last year. Its average revenue per Facebook user increased at a 28 percent clip in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016. That year-on-year growth rate is higher than the 26 percent recorded in the third quarter.

But there were numbers that investors will keep an eye on. Changes Facebook made to its news feed reduced the “time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day.” Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.

Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.

The Federal Reserve, as was widely expected, left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. But the market focused on the change to the Fed’s inflation language.

Today’s statement on inflation:

The statement from the December meeting:

Though the market expected the Fed to raise rates at its March meeting, that language change caused stocks to briefly turn negative. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index, which had traded as high as 2839, slipped to 2817 an hour after the Fed’s statement. It recovered in the final hour of trading to finish up at 2824.

Reactions:

Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote that the change to the Fed’s inflation language was “decisive” and a hawkish signal. The bank also noted: “Adding to the conviction of higher inflation, the FOMC noted that market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low. This shows that the Fed is taking notice of the recent shift in market perception about inflation.”

Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics: “In short, the statement sets up the March hike, which will be followed by Jay Powell’s first press conference. We’re expecting continuity of approach, at least for a while.”

Greg McBride, Bankrate.com: “While there is a lot of continuity between Yellen and Powell, many other faces on the committee are changing, and this could mean a Fed that is more inclined to raise interest rates than what we’ve become accustomed to under Janet Yellen.”

Analysts over at Deutsche Bank think the chances are increasing. They write:

The analysts add:

The context: A S&P Dow Jones Indices committee meets twice a year to review the makeup the Dow industrials.

G.E. was among 12 original Dow components when the index was started in 1896 and is the only one of those companies still in the Dow. After briefly being removed twice during the Dow’s first five years, G.E. has been a member of the index for more than 110 years.

A federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s director can only be fired by the president for cause. The NYT’s Stacy Cowley reports:

The European Union appears to be leaning against striking a special deal for London, instead giving the financial center more limited access to the European single market.

Stephen Cutler, who until the end of 2015 was the bank’s general counsel, will become a litigation partner at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, according to the WSJ.

Since then, he has been a vice chairman of the firm. Before joining JPMorgan in 2006, he worked as the head of enforcement at the S.E.C. and as a top securities lawyer at what was then Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr.

Shares of Boeing are up 6.3 percent after the company’s earnings easily beat expectations.

The aerospace company reported a profit of $3.06 a share excluding the tax gain. Analysts had expected $2.90 a share. Revenue jumped 8.9 percent to $25.4 billion. Analysts had forecast $24.7 billion in sales.

Boeing’s rally Wednesday has accounted for about 50 percent of the Dow Jones industrial average’s 250 point gain in early trading.

Boeing’s 12 percent rally over the past year has powered the Dow’s run to record highs. Earlier this month when the Dow surpassed 26000 just eight days after topping 25000, Boeing accounted for about a third of the index’s 1,000-point gain.

At least, that’s what the president said in last night’s State of the Union address. But how much progress can he make on either front?

More from Julie Davis and Michael Shear of the NYT:

Mr. Trump offered few details on his infrastructure proposal. A report by McKinsey & Company says that a comprehensive fix would cost $1.8 trillion, while the American Society of Civil Engineers put the price tag at $2 trillion.

All but $200 billion is supposed to come from private investors, but lawmakers are skeptical. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, told reporters, “You tell me how we pay for it, and I’ll tell you what we can do.”

“Leveraging private dollars is a good start,” he added, “but we got a lot of work to do.”

Don’t forget immigration

Congress has until Feb. 8 to agree on government funding, and Democrats say they still want a deal to protect the young immigrants known as Dreamers. The White House’s immigration proposal isn’t sitting well with them — nor with some House Republicans. Meanwhile, businesses are preparing for the worst if legal protections for the Dreamers expire in March.

President Trump also touted the trickle-down effect of the tax overhaul during Tuesday’s State of the Union address:

The tax law indeed has prompted hundreds of employers, including at least 40 members of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, to pass on savings to workers.

Much of those perks have come in the form of one-time bonuses. Many companies have also said they would increase base wages, expand benefits and raise charitable donations.

Here’s a closer look at what companies are doing:

Warren Buffett has called the U.S. health care system “a hungry tapeworm on the American economy” because of its ever-growing costs. So his Berkshire Hathaway has teamed up with Amazon and JPMorgan Chase to create a new — and as of now largely undefined — health care provider.

Our colleague Peter Eavis had four questions about the initiative:

• What is it, beyond the thin description of an independent company “free from profit-making incentives and constraints”?

• How big will it be?

• What expertise will these companies bring?

• How will this venture cut costs?

The numbers that matter

• $18,764: the average premium for family coverage for employees nationwide, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

• 30 percent: the current amount of the premium paid for by workers.

• 5 percent and 7 percent: how much the shares of Anthem and Cigna fell yesterday. (Insurers and prescription benefits managers as a whole took a hit on the news.)

Critics’ corner

• Margot Sanger-Katz and Reed Abelson offer reasons to temper expectations. (Upshot)

• Robert Cyran writes, “Amazon is already perceived as a potential threat to many U.S. businesses. Add other big employers, and the threat is multiplied.” (Breakingviews)

One of the icons of 20th-century corporate America, the long-struggling company will now be controlled by Fujifilm Holdings of Japan.

It’s a complicated transaction

• Xerox will be folded into an existing 55-year-old joint venture.

• Xerox investors will receive a special cash dividend of $9.80 a share and will own 49.9 percent of the combined business, which will be publicly traded.

• The move is expected to save at least $1.7 billion in costs, though Fujifilm will cut 10,000 jobs.

The context: Xerox has struggled over the years with a decline in corporate printing, and it spun out its business services unit last year. Two of its biggest investors, Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, have pressured the company to explore a deal — including revising or ending the Fujifilm joint venture.

Behind the deal: Fujifilm relied on Mitsubishi UFJ, Morgan Stanley and the law firm Morrison & Foerster. (It is also borrowing from Citigroup and Morgan Stanley.) Xerox took advice from Centerview Partners and the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.

Blackstone’s $20 billion deal (including debt) for control of the company’s financial and risk division highlights the growing ambitions of private equity firms — and how they need to spend nearly $1 trillion in uninvested capital.

Behind the deal

Blackstone believes that the financial and risk division, which includes Thomson Reuters’s Eikon terminal service, can continue to grow. “We are excited to partner with Thomson Reuters — one of the most trusted companies in financial technology,” Martin Brand of Blackstone said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Thomson Reuters gets a cash infusion as it competes against Bloomberg LP and tries to deal with customers spending less on financial data. Bloomberg pointed out that the company’s controlling Thomson family is essentially retreating to the news business.

Critics’ corner

• SoftBank’s Vision Fund finally struck a deal to invest $300 million in Wag, the dog-walking start-up. (NYT)

January has been the worst month for the virtual currency in three years, with its price down 30 percent. And it’s because of the very thing that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were supposed to be free from: central authorities and regulators.

• The S.E.C. froze a $600 million initial coin offering yesterday run by AriseBank.

• China has continued to clamp down on Bitcoin mining.

• South Korea is still weighing legal checks on virtual currency trading.

Add in Facebook’s banning of ads for digital money, and mining or trading virtual currencies has become a lot harder.

But not everyone has gotten the memo: The Japanese messaging service Line has plans to open its own virtual currency exchange, while the embattled publisher of Penthouse magazine wants to promote its own adult-entertainment-focused token.

As Steve Wynn faces allegations of sexual assault and other misconduct, the board of his casino empire is increasingly coming under scrutiny, too.

The proxy adviser ISS has long criticized the compensation of Mr. Wynn over the years, going so far as to say that the company had an “overall corporate governance profile that ranks among the worst, not the best, of U.S. companies.”

The board said that it was setting up an independent committee to look into the allegations. It will be led by Patricia Mulroy, Wynn’s only female director and a former official at Nevada’s gaming commission.

Meanwhile, investigating Wynn are gaming regulators for Nevada, Massachusetts and Macau.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• How did a divisive statement written on Air Force One last year come together, and how much did President Trump oversee the process? Prosecutors have recently questioned numerous White House officials to find out.

Our Washington reporters compiled a detailed timeline of how the administration responded to news of a meeting in 2016 between Russians and top Trump campaign officials. A statement described it as being about a Russian adoption policy; in fact, it involved an offer of political dirt about Hillary Clinton.

• On Wednesday, the F.B.I. condemned a push by House Republicans to release a secret memo said to show how law enforcement officials abused their authority in the Russia inquiry. Mr. Trump has said he wants the document released.

• During his State of the Union address, President Trump noted that “Americans are Dreamers, too,” adopting a term used to refer to hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally.

The reaction in Congress was sharply divided on Wednesday, and the two sides in the immigration debate now seem further apart than ever.

Separately, White House officials left the details of the president’s $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan to Congress. Even labor groups that have long backed increased infrastructure spending reacted coolly: “That’s not a plan. That’s a hope,” the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said.

• Mr. Trump sent no new detainees to the wartime prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, during the first year of his presidency. We look at the problems that have steered the administration to other options.

• The Justice Department dropped charges against Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat, on Wednesday, underscoring how a 2016 Supreme Court ruling raised the bar for corruption cases against elected officials.

Separately, Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, resigned over criticism  of her investments in tobacco and health care companies.

• Nearly 7,000 Syrians who were granted temporary permission to live and work in the U.S. will be allowed to stay for at least 18 more months because of the continuing civil war in their country, the administration announced.

• Prosecutors are seeking information about some of the world’s biggest sports organizations, and exploring possible racketeering, money laundering and fraud charges.

FIFA, the International Olympic Committee and the U.S. Olympic Committee are among those under scrutiny; the investigation is also looking at business executives involved in bids for major sporting events.

• Separately, an international tribunal today reinstated most of the Russian athletes who had been barred from the Olympics for doping, but the I.O.C. said it still might not allow them to compete in the Winter Games this month in South Korea.

• People will most likely spend less time on Facebook as a result of News Feed changes. But less can be more, the company explained to a worried Wall Street.

• Months after its enormous security breach, Equifax introduced an app to help customers lock access to their credit files. It didn’t work.

• Xerox, once such an American corporate powerhouse that its name became a verb,  is coming under Japanese control.

• More than a million Twitter followers  have disappeared since a Times investigation about the proliferation of fake accounts.

• U.S. stocks were up on Wednesday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today.

Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.

• Have you given up on your New Year’s resolution? Get back on track.

• Prepare for the big game with our favorite Super Bowl recipes.

• Gochujang, a spicy Korean condiment, makes for a great braised chicken dinner.

• Partisan writing you shouldn’t miss

Writers from across the political spectrum discuss the State of the Union address.

• Generation Z picks a better name

Last week we asked readers 22 and younger to tell us what they’d like their generation to be called.

“Don’t call us anything,” one wrote. “The whole notion of cohesive generations is nonsense.” Here are some of the other responses.

• Hut! Hut! What?

The distinctive command of football is not “Now!” or “Go!” It’s “Hut!” Even players aren’t sure why.

We also spoke to Nick Foles, the Philadelphia Eagles’ starting quarterback in the Super Bowl on Sunday.

• Jamaican pioneers

The Winter Olympics are around the corner, but let’s talk about the Summer Games for a moment.

Despite being surrounded by water, Jamaica has never had a synchronized swimming team at the Olympics. We met some girls who are trying to change that.

• Best of late-night TV

Samantha Bee maintained a steady drum beat of coverage against workplace harassment.

• Quotation of the day

“When you make $13 an hour and you have to pay rent and buy groceries, you can’t afford an Uber. I can barely afford a seven-day MetroCard.”

• The Times, in other words

Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles.

On this day in 1887, Harvey Wilcox, a real estate developer from Kansas, filed a plan with Los Angeles County for a small, gridded subdivision that he called Hollywood. (The origin of the name is a subject of dispute.)

Over the next decade, Mr. Wilcox and his wife, Daeida, conjured out of the desert a strict Christian community of orchards and Victorian cottages, connected to Los Angeles by a lone streetcar line.

There were just a few hundred residents, and the hamlet banned alcohol, bowling alleys and even, briefly, movie theaters. But in 1910, Hollywood voted to merge with Los Angeles.

Soon, movie studios fled the enforcement of Thomas Edison’s monopoly on film patents and started setting up in the ideal Southern California light.

In 1923, the Hollywoodland sign went up (it was truncated to Hollywood in 1949). The original sign was an illuminated billboard for a segregated housing development that called itself a fortress against “metropolitanism”; one ad urged, “Protect your family.”

The sign was left up as the so-called Golden Age of Hollywood arrived, a noirish era embodied by the starlet Peg Entwistle, who jumped to her death from the H in 1932.

Colin Stretch, the general counsel of Facebook, appeared on Tuesday before senators who are investigating how Russia spread misinformation online during the 2016 presidential campaign. Along with Google and Twitter, Facebook has been blamed for helping Russian agents influence the outcome of the election.

But the cloud over Facebook extends far beyond Russia. Critics say the company’s central role in modern communication has undermined the news business, split Americans into partisan echo chambers and “hijacked” our minds with a product designed to keep us addicted to the social network.

Of course, criticism of Facebook and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, is easy to come by; solutions aren’t as clear. We asked nine technologists, academics, politicians and journalists to propose the steps they would take to improve Facebook — as a product, a company or both.

Their responses, edited slightly for length and clarity, are below.

Research director at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism. 

With a recent Facebook change that algorithmically prioritizes “reactions” in the news feed over the standard “like,” the company appears to be pushing further into the realm of emotion-centered engagement. As they stand, and especially with algorithmic reinforcement, “reactions” and “likes” are like megaphones for echo chambers and news outrage.

The single most important step Facebook — and its subsidiary Instagram, which I view as equally important in terms of countering misinformation, hate speech and propaganda — can take is to abandon the focus on emotional signaling-as-engagement.

This is a tough proposition, of course, as billions of users have been trained to do exactly this: “react.”

What if there were a “trust emoji”? Or respect-based emojis? If a palette of six emoji-faced angry-love-sad-haha emotional buttons continues to be the way we engage with one another — and how we respond to the news — then it’s going to be an uphill battle.

Negative emotion, click bait and viral outrage are how the platform is “being used to divide.” Given this problem, Facebook needs to help us unite by building new sharing tools based on trust and respect.

Co-founder of Wired magazine.

Facebook should reduce anonymity by requiring real verification of real names for real people, with the aim of having 100 percent of individuals verified.

Companies would need additional levels of verification, and should have a label and scrutiny different from those of people. (Whistle-blowers and dissidents might need to use a different platform.)

Facebook could also offer an optional filter that would keep any post (or share) of an unverified account from showing up. I’d use that filter.

Democrat representing California’s 17th Congressional District, which includes sections of Silicon Valley. 

Ultimately, whether from tech companies or Congress, what people want is more transparency.

Facebook should expand on its Hard Questions blog to explain how its news feed algorithms work, how it uses data in targeting and how it makes decisions about third-party verification and removing offensive content. It should make it simple for users to provide feedback and be responsive to their concerns.

The company also should make its executives readily available to the press, and they should spend time on Capitol Hill to explain their decision-making.

Everyone understands that new technology platforms are not perfect, and that bad actors find ways to abuse them. The key is for Facebook to be upfront about technical challenges, open about its mistakes and willing to answer the tough questions honestly. If it does that, it will continue to earn the public’s trust.

Chief executive of Upworthy and author of “The Filter Bubble.”

Facebook should open itself up for independent research. Right now, Facebook is a black box: It’s very difficult, and in many cases impossible, for researchers to independently look at behavior on the platform. While opening private data to research creates risks, there’s a ton of explicitly public data on the platform that Facebook makes difficult to query at scale. Facebook could also open up many of the tools advertisers currently use for free use by research scientists. It would be a bold move for transparency, and one that would help us understand much better what’s happening on the world’s most important social platform. And it’d be wise to do this before regulators forced them to.

The company should also optimize for “time well spent.” Facebook’s greatest superpower is figuring out how to eat as much of our attention as possible. But as Tristan Harris and others have pointed out, that attention often doesn’t yield much — leaving us poorly informed and feeling worse about ourselves. Instead of measuring clicks and likes, what if Facebook optimized for how much value an article or video or game gave us weeks or months afterward? The company could survey the kinds of content we’ve spent the most time on, and ask us which gave us the most and least value, as a way to balance our impulsive present selves with our greater aspirations.

Early Facebook employee who recounted her time at the company in her book, “The Boy Kings: A Journey Into the Heart of the Social Network.”

It would be interesting if Facebook offered a “vintage Facebook” setting that users could toggle to, without News Feed ads and “like” buttons. (Before “likes,” users wrote comments, which made interactions more unique and memorable.)

A “vintage Facebook” setting not only would be less cluttered, it would refocus the experience of using Facebook on the people using it, and their intentions for communication and interaction.

Somehow, no matter how “smart” the Facebook algorithms and behind-the-scenes data processing get, the site felt more engaging as a tool for human communication when interaction was primarily driven by what users wanted to do and say, rather than where the algorithms want people to look.

Assistant professor of communication at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Facebook should allow users to sort their news feed chronologically by default on all platforms, rather than rely on an algorithmically sorted News Feed. This would increase the diversity of items in the News Feed, and would make it more likely that users were exposed to people and information that didn’t support their own confirmation bias.

It should also greatly increase the human oversight of ad targeting systems — specifically, oversee algorithmically generated categories (rather than basing them solely on user-inputted interests). Political and interest-based advertising should be under much stricter scrutiny than, say, the advertising of T-shirts or hair products.

Chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact and a former chief executive of Reddit.

Facebook needs to replace its focus on engagement quantity with interaction quality. To really do that means replacing at least half of the leadership team and board with underrepresented people of color who are informed and value diversity and inclusion — and, as my colleague Freada Kapor Klein suggested, have journalistic principles. At Reddit, I was able to effect positive, lasting change (at least according to this research) to content quality and interaction quality by building a diverse executive team.

Adviser and former news executive at NPR, NBC News and Twitter.

The single most important thing Facebook must do is come clean. Tell us what you know. Tell us what you know but can’t share. Tell us what you don’t know. And tell us what you don’t know that you don’t know. Stop hiding behind bromides like “we are not a media company.” That makes us think you don’t understand you have a serious set of problems that need fixing. Coming clean may not be the only thing, and may not be the main thing, but it’s the first thing.

Professor at Columbia Law School and author of “The Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads.”

Facebook should become a public benefit corporation. These companies must aim to do something that would aid the public, and board members must also take that public benefit into account when making decisions. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Facebook’s goals are “bringing us closer together” and “building a global community.” Worthy, beautiful goals, but easier said than done when Facebook is also stuck delivering ever-increasing profits and making its platform serve the needs of advertisers.

What if Facebook were actually free to do what it says it wants to? What if it didn’t need to devote so much energy to the evil sides of the business, whether catering to filter bubbles, addicting and manipulating users, seizing data, bending over backward for advertisers and destroying competitors? As a nonprofit or public benefit corporation (like Kickstarter), Facebook could be a much better institution. It could shed its “two masters” dilemma, truly pursue its lofty goals and become a firm of which its users and the world could actually be proud.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Emilie König, 33, spent the past five years living in Syria, where she was a prominent propagandist and recruiter for the Islamic State. Now she wants to return home — to France.

The quandary her case poses is an increasingly common problem for European countries: What should they do when citizens, who are also militants, want to return?

Meanwhile, fighting rages in Idlib Province, the last major insurgent stronghold in Syria. The U.N. expressed alarm over assaults by Russian-backed Syrian forces, which it said had put tens of thousands of civilians at risk.

• President Trump  stirred outrage when he told lawmakers that he’d like to see more immigrants from Norway, and not from  “shithole countries,” including Haiti and those in Africa.

Mr. Trump is expected to stop short of reimposing strict sanctions on Iran today, but he is expected to give the U.S. Congress and European allies a deadline to improve the 2015 nuclear deal or see the U.S. withdraw.

On Twitter, Mr. Trump said that he had canceled his trip to London, where he was expected to open the new U.S. Embassy. He accused his predecessor of making a “bad deal” in moving the embassy.

Meanwhile, the privacy movement that emerged after the 2013 leaks by Edward Snowden suffered a major setback when the House voted against restricting a warrantless surveillance program.

• The British government dismissed the idea of a second referendum on the country’s departure from the European Union.

The idea has gradually been gaining ground. Even Nigel Farage, the populist politician who prominently campaigned for Brexit, has hinted he might favor holding another vote.

While a second referendum is possible, odds are it will not happen.

• Mark Zuckerberg  spoke to us about sweeping changes being made to Facebook’s News Feed.

“We want to make sure that our products are not just fun but are good for people,” said Mr. Zuckerberg, the company’s founder. “We need to refocus the system.”

If you’re among the network’s more than two billion users, expect to see fewer viral videos and news articles in the coming weeks, and more posts that include interactions between you and the people you know.

• The Winter Olympics kick off next month in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

That made us wonder: How is climate change affecting the Winter Games? We looked at other cities that have hosted the Games and found that by 2050, many of them may be too warm to host again. (Above, a venue for snowboarding and skiing events in Pyeongchang.)

Our travel desk compiled a roundup of some of the big sports events this year, including, of course, the soccer World Cup in Russia.

• Garbage  is piling up in Germany, Britain, Ireland and elsewhere since China banned imports of some kinds of recyclable waste.

• Kering, the French conglomerate, is spinning off its shares in Puma as part of a long-held ambition to focus on the luxury market.

• How do car companies settle on a new vehicle’s name? It’s an art mixed with science and public outreach.

• In soccer news, Lionel Messi scored twice in three minutes to help Barcelona, the defending champion, advance to the Copa del Rey quarterfinals.

• Rome’s much-derided Christmas tree, known as Spelacchio, has been dismantled. It is going to be repurposed into a hut for baby nursing.

• In memoriam: José Molina, a Spanish-born dancer who brought flamenco to U.S. audiences, died at 81.

• Sometimes it seems as if we’re living under a constant barrage of heavy news. But it isn’t all bad out there. This week’s roundup of good news includes Winnie the Pooh, winter heroes and baby turtles.

“Hello. I’m Johnny Cash.”

With those words, Mr. Cash kicked off a concert at a state prison in California that revitalized his music career and fortified his outlaw persona. Recorded 50 years ago on Saturday, “At Folsom Prison” remains a landmark in American music.

Entertaining inmates — while taunting their guards — was tame compared with the other exploits of the Man in Black.

In 1965, Mr. Cash accidentally started a forest fire in Southern California that burned hundreds of acres and devastated a population of endangered condors. (Mr. Cash told a judge, “I don’t care about your damn yellow buzzards.”) Later in life, he was attacked by an ostrich and almost died.

In a dispute with his label in the 1980s, Mr. Cash released a parody called “Chicken in Black.” He called the track “intentionally atrocious,” but it was the most successful thing he’d done in years. (There’s even a video.)

Mr. Cash, who died in 2003, was a Morse Code expert in the Air Force who eavesdropped on Soviet chatter. He was even an ordained minister and wrote a novel, “The Man in White,” about the Apostle Paul.

As Mr. Cash told The Times in a 1969 interview, “Ain’t nothin’ too weird for me.”

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• After a year of legislative setbacks, Republicans demonstrated their control of Washington on Wednesday, sending a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul to President Trump for his signature.

It’s unclear if Mr. Trump will sign the bill before the end of the year, as it could affect negotiations to fund the government and avert a shutdown.

The president and congressional Republicans have said that the new tax code will create jobs and raise wages. If it does, it would  contradict historical experience and the assessments of many experts.

• We explain how to write off donations under the plan, and answer the question on everyone’s mind: Will my taxes go up or down?

• President Trump has threatened to end American aid to any country that votes today in favor of a U.N. resolution denouncing his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.

“Let them vote against us; we’ll save a lot,” Mr. Trump said. “We don’t care.”

• Making good on the threat could mean cutting off assistance to some crucial strategic allies in the Middle East. Some aid programs, like Egypt’s, are congressionally mandated.

• After a deadly commuter train crash in California nine years ago, Congress ordered all passenger railroads to install automatic-braking systems by 2016.

But the deadline was extended, and preventable crashes such as Monday’s deadly accident in Washington State keep happening.

Railroads have cited the cost and complexity of adding the technology, called positive train control, estimating a total price of more than $10 billion.

• “We put a man on the moon 50 years ago, faster than we’ve been able to implement positive train control,” a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board said. “I mean, come on.”

• The driver of a vehicle who injured 19 people in Melbourne today is mentally ill, officials said, saying he had committed a deliberate “act of evil” but not terrorism.

• The police arrested the driver, a 32-year-old Australian citizen of Afghan descent, but did not identify him. He was known to the authorities and had a history of criminal assaults and drug abuse.

• Dozens of major employers — including Amazon, Goldman Sachs and Target — placed recruitment ads on Facebook that were limited to particular age groups, an investigation by ProPublica and The Times found.

Facebook defended the practice, but several experts questioned whether it violated anti-discrimination laws.

• Glenn Thrush, a prominent political reporter at The Times accused of inappropriate sexual behavior, will remain suspended until late January and will then be removed from the team covering the White House.

“While we believe that Glenn has acted offensively, we have decided that he does not deserve to be fired,” Dean Baquet, the executive editor, said.

• The author of the short story “Cat Person,” which was shared widely on social media after appearing in The New Yorker this month, is said to have received a seven-figure book deal.

• U.S. stocks were down on Wednesday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets.

Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.

• Learn how to solve The New York Times crossword. (Beginners welcome.)

• Sexual harassment training isn’t enough. Here are things that work.

• Recipe of the day: Try roasted salmon glazed with brown sugar and mustard.

• Dancing down the years

Today’s 360 video continues our series in which dancers of retirement age reflect on why they’re still practicing. “The body has this incredible way of healing itself and finding itself anew,” Brenda Bufalino, 80, said.

• Catalonia votes, again

Today’s election could decide whether the Spanish region persists in its drive for independence or seeks a settlement with the central government after months of feuding. Here’s what to watch for.

• One-vote win lasts for one day

A day after a recount gave Democrats a single-vote victory in a Virginia House of Delegates race, a panel of judges declared the race tied. Control of the House may be decided by the equivalent of a coin toss.

• It’s the shortest day of the year

Or the longest, if you’re in the Southern Hemisphere.

We explain how the winter solstice works, and why humans might not exist without it.

• The year in sports

Relive the incredible comebacks, unbelievable shots and memorable performances of 2017.

• Best of late-night TV

Samantha Bee discussed the small group of evangelical Christians who pushed for Jerusalem to be recognized as Israel’s capital. “Of course, Armageddon is the one thing that Trump happens to get done with absolute precision,” she said.

• Quotation of the day

“This has been a year of extraordinary accomplishment for the Trump administration.”

— Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, who has often been at odds with the president, celebrating the passage of the tax overhaul.

This is the time of year the Krampus, a mythical, furry, horned beast, prowls cities and towns in the Bavarian and Austrian Alps, scaring away evil spirits and reminding naughty children that Christmas is around the corner.

The tradition of the Krampus, a mountain goblin who is an evil counterpart to the good St. Nicholas, has recently enjoyed a revival. Even before the 2015 Hollywood horror version brought the tradition to millions of Americans, a new generation of Germans and Austrians was reviving a tradition cherished in childhood.

Dozens of “runs,” or parades of people dressed in horned masks and carrying whips or bells, take over towns in southern Germany and Austria from the last weeks of November to Dec. 23.

In a 2014 appearance on “The Tonight Show,” the actor Christoph Waltz explained Krampus to an American audience: the Austrian answer to Elf on the Shelf.

The Krampus, he said, does not just spy on kids and report back to Santa, but arrives with a stick, a bag and threats. “If you weren’t good, you get stuck in the bag and hit and shipped off,” he said.

Modern Krampus parades, however, are bound by strictly enforced rules, including no drinking and no hitting. Scaring children and tourists is allowed, but not sticking anyone in a bag.
