SYDNEY, Australia Â AustraliaÂs boys-club political culture appeared in recent weeks to receive a healthy dose of #MeToo disruption.

First, Robert Doyle, the lord mayor of Melbourne, resigned after two members of the City Council accused him of groping them. Days later, Barnaby Joyce, the deputy prime minister, stepped down after he confessed to an affair with a staff member and was then accused by another woman of harassment.

The scandal surrounding Mr. Joyce even prompted Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to ban members of Parliament from having sex with their subordinates Â the first time in five years that the rules on ministerial conduct had been updated.

But according to women who work in the halls of Australian power, the scandals in February were but a tiny sampling of the pervasive culture of sexual harassment endemic to the countryÂs politics.

Less than a third of the Australian Parliament is female. Canberra, the capital, is frequently described as an old boyÂs club, with many menÂs connections Â and attitudes about sexual conduct Â starting in the elite universities and the youth wings of the major parties that guide the politically ambitious through their 20s.

ÂIt was clear that a bully boy culture had accumulated over many, many years,Â said Ellen Sandell, a Greens politician and member of the Victorian State Parliament. ÂItÂs got to start somewhere.Â

That culture of harassment and protection for powerful men, women say, has prevented more accusers from speaking publicly about encounters with politicians. It has also, they say, stymied a more robust #MeToo movement Â akin to those that have rattled Washington and Hollywood Â from taking hold.

ÂI know it prevented a number of other victims and witnessesÂ feeling safe to come forward,Â said Tessa Sullivan, a former Melbourne City Council member who accused Mr. Doyle of harassment. ÂA number of politicians knew about my abuse and tried to deter me from speaking out.Â

AustraliaÂs universities are in the early phases of a reckoning.

Over the past few years, students at the University of Sydney, Australian National University and on several other campuses have mobilized against Ârape culture,Â drawing attention to a lack of punishment for sexual assault and harassment.

Their efforts led to a nationwide survey of 31,000 university students in which 51 percent said they were sexually harassed at least once in 2016. Advocates said the actual figure might be even higher; in most cases, neither the victims nor bystanders report the episodes Â often because they feel nothing will be done.

Many Australian women a generation removed said it was at least as bad or worse during their student days. And, they said, the culture of student politics did not help.

Each of AustraliaÂs main political parties has an active youth wing Â the Young Liberals promote themselves to anyone ages 16 to 31; Young Labor focuses on anyone under 26 Â and their efforts often overlap with on-campus campaigns.

Many lawmakers started out in this milieu, with student bodies or union boards, before moving to staffing roles, party offices or legislatures. Three of AustraliaÂs five most recent prime ministers Â Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott and John Howard Â began their political careers as students at the University of Sydney.

The dynamics of power in these groups have not been equal. Women make up only 29 percent of the Young Liberals membership, according to the groupÂs website. Student leaders say men tend to dominate the senior ranks across parties and campuses.

Regular gatherings of young people in politics Â like the annual National Union of Students conference in December Â are also notorious for alcohol-fueled inappropriate behavior.

ÂAt one of them, a Queensland Labor man threatened to rape me as I was walking back to my room,Â said Tammy Franks, a Greens member of the South Australian Legislative Council, who was active in student politics in the Â90s. ÂI was on the sexual harassment and grievance committee, and there was a lot of that type of behavior.Â

Politicians have carried their university-bred attitudes up the ranks for decades.

Jacqui Munro, a former Liberal staff member in New South Wales who joined the party in 2011, says the Âmixture of older adults and young staffersÂ in many political workplaces can produce situations where professional and personal boundaries are poorly defined.

Mr. Joyce, the deputy prime minister, ended up having an extramarital affair with a younger member of his staff Â thatÂs the extreme. But there are other problems with combining power, proximity and desire.

ÂCloseness can sometimes be misread, especially if alcoholÂs involved,Â Ms. Munro said. ÂPeople can be inappropriately handsy, and sometimes get away with things because itÂs considered a bit too difficult to manage in a long-term sense. You just sort of address it quietly.Â

That tendency to Âaddress it quietlyÂ Â driven in part by the expectation of party loyalty Â often works to preserve the careers of predatory men while women who lodge allegations frequently face an intense backlash. One of the women who accused Mr. Joyce of harassment (a claim he denies) was identified publicly by The Australian, a national conservative newspaper, without her consent.

And public shaming Â also common on university campuses Â frequently leads to perpetual silence, or whispering.

Ms. Sullivan, the former Melbourne council member whose allegation helped topple the cityÂs mayor (he denies the accusation), said women working in Australian politics frequently warn one another privately about male colleaguesÂ conduct, but are often reluctant to accuse their harassers publicly.

ÂFemale politicians,Â she said, understand that they have Âto take steps to protect themselves from being violated.Â

The threats and abuse span parties and states.

Ms. Sandell, the Victorian Parliament member, made headlines in 2016 when she called out sexist bullying on the chamberÂs floor. Sexual harassment had become so pervasive, she said, tour guides stopped allowing primary school students to watch debates taking place in the chamber.

In Canberra last year, a young volunteer accused the Greens party of mishandling her complaint about an older party member whom she accused of sexually assaulting her on election night.

In South Australia, Ms. Franks said she, too, sees signs of a Âtoxic culture.Â

ÂPeople act like spoiled teenagers, and because they have a lot of power they think they can get away with it,Â she said. ÂItÂs like ÂMean GirlsÂ in reverse. ÂMean Blokes.ÂÂ

AustraliaÂs main political parties, in the wake of scandal after scandal, have said they are trying to improve their relations with women.

But with the issue confronted only weakly for years, many women in and out of Australian politics say the country must do more to hold men accountable at every phase of life Â and to ensure that women are not pushed aside by a culture of abuse.

ÂMy advice for women who wish to join politics is to find your voice before joining,Â Ms. Sullivan said. ÂYou will need bravery.Â

But, she added, Âplease do give it a go, because we need more women to help shape the world we all live in.Â

PLAINVILLE, Conn. Â When William A. Petit Jr. was campaigning door to door here for a seat in the State Legislature, he did not have to worry about getting residents to remember his name. They already knew it.

The candidate, once a successful physician who hailed from a prominent family in this Hartford suburb of 17,000, had survived an unimaginable tragedy: Nearly 10 years earlier, his wife and two daughters were brutally murdered during an hourslong home invasion, leaving him beaten and broken.

ÂPeople would say they were sorry for what happened to him and he would say, ÂThank you very much; IÂm running for representative,ÂÂ recalled Deborah Tompkins, a Plainville councilwoman who knocked on doors with Mr. Petit, a Republican, in the fall of 2016. ÂHe is a very smooth deflector.Â

For Mr. Petit, it was a long, painful road from the aftermath of one of the most shocking crimes in ConnecticutÂs history to a seat in the stateÂs House of Representatives. In between were years of therapy; the formation of a foundation to honor his slain familyÂs legacy; two murder trials (one for each assailant); and his unsuccessful effort to block the stateÂs repeal of the death penalty, a move that led to the resentencing of the convicted killers to life without parole.

But as the 10th anniversary of the killings came and went last July, Mr. Petit, 60, was no longer defined by tragedy.

With the blessing of his late wifeÂs family, he remarried in 2012. His wife, Christine, is a photographer who had volunteered for the Petit Family Foundation. The couple have a young son, also named William. The foundation has raised more than $2.2 million to address chronic illness and violence and to encourage women in the sciences. (Before her death, his 17-year-old daughter, Hayley, was headed to Dartmouth, his alma mater, and planned to be a doctor.)

Mr. Petit gave up his diabetes practice immediately after the killings to focus on the foundation. But he has deployed his medical expertise in the legislature, where he serves on the public health committee. At a recent Âpizza and politicsÂ event for constituents, he sounded as much the doctor as the politician when asked about legalizing marijuana.

ÂAt the moment, given the data, itÂs hard for me to be in favor of it,Â he said. ÂThereÂs good data that shows that when younger people, and even adults, use marijuana on a regular basis, there are long-lasting impacts on I.Q., decision making and executive function.Â

Quiet and low-key, Mr. Petit is not the first victim of a horrific tragedy to enter politics in the New York region. In the 1990s, Carolyn McCarthy won a seat in Congress after her husband was among six passengers killed when a mentally ill man opened fire on a Long Island commuter train. Ms. McCarthy became a tenacious advocate for gun control in Congress.

Mr. Petit declined to be interviewed for this article; his office said that Mr. Petit wanted Âto decrease his personal publicity, choosing instead to focus on his family and legislative work.Â

Friends and colleagues said that it made sense that Mr. Petit would seek a life in public service, pointing to his familyÂs longstanding involvement in politics in Plainville, where he grew up. ÂIÂm not surprised that he entered politics at all,Â said Ms. Tompkins, noting that both Mr. PetitÂs father and sister served on the town council. ÂThe Petit family is a big deal in Plainville.Â

Every year since the home invasion, Bob Heslin, a former high school classmate of Mr. PetitÂs, and Mr. HeslinÂs brother, Gary, have organized a road race to benefit the foundation. In the early years turnout was especially large, and Mr. Petit found himself speaking to crowds of up to 3,000 people. As Mr. Heslin sees it, Mr. Petit needed a new calling; politics was a natural outgrowth of his foundation work and criminal-justice advocacy.

ÂHe was very successful as a doctor and at the top of his game, but after the tragedy he didnÂt feel comfortable getting back into that for his own reasons,Â Mr. Heslin said. ÂPossibly he couldnÂt sit there and give full attention to his patients anymore. Through the court process, I think he realized that he could be effective and have a positive influence on the politics here.Â

Mr. PetitÂs colleagues said that while the tragedy was certainly a factor in his public service, he has balanced his own history with broader objectives. He has backed legislation that would impose tougher penalties on career criminals, but also pressed for fiscal restraint, joining a bipartisan effort to impose caps on state spending.

There was a time, according to interviews Mr. Petit has given, when he seemed doomed to endlessly replay his familyÂs suffering. He himself was beaten with a baseball bat and lost several pints of blood, managing to escape moments before the house went up in flames.

In the early months of the foundationÂs existence, Mr. Petit struggled to make it through meetings without crying. He attended every day of each of the two trials, fighting off nausea as he neared the courthouse. He considered suicide.

A former neighbor in Cheshire, Bob Picozzi, remembers emailing Mr. Petit at Christmas, five months after the attack. ÂHe said, ÂI am putting on my best face, but I wish we could just cancel it this year,ÂÂ he said.

In an interview with the Hartford Courant last summer, Mr. Petit credited his gradual healing to family and friends. ÂIf you suffered a significant loss, significant injury Â psychological, physical Â itÂs tough,Â he said. ÂI certainly wasnÂt jumping out of bed in 2007 and 2008. I had a vast circle of support, and I realize that a lot of people donÂt have the support that I had.Â

Mr. Petit considered running for Congress in 2014, but chose to spend more time with his new wife and baby, friends said. In early 2016, Helen Bergenty, then the Plainville town Republican chairwoman, telephoned him in Florida where he was vacationing to urge him to run for the State Legislature. ÂI said, ÂYou need to get some experience in Hartford before you run for governor,ÂÂ Ms. Bergenty recalled.

During the campaign against Betty Boukus, an 11-term Democrat, Mr. Petit did his best to focus on the issues. Right before the election, however, a labor-financed political action committee unveiled an advertisement trying to tie Mr. Petit to Donald J. TrumpÂs Âattack on women and families.Â Amid denunciations from Republicans and Democrats, the union official behind the ad resigned.

In his first year in office, Mr. Petit has attended Polish festivals Â his sliver of the town of New Britain is heavily Polish Â and learned the intricacies of bill-making. But Ms. Bergenty has not forgotten the governorship, especially in a year when the incumbent, Dannel P. Malloy, has decided not to seek re-election.

ÂHe would be a terrific governor,Â she said of Mr. Petit. ÂBut heÂs not ready. He would have to campaign all over the state and itÂs very time-consuming.Â

Whatever Mr. PetitÂs future holds, neighbors and constituents say they are heartened by his transformation. ÂPeople are very happy for him, especially anybody who saw him after what happened,Â Ms. Tompkins, the Plainville councilwoman, said. ÂThat he actually came back to life was such a good thing.Â

THE NEIGHBORHOOD By Mario Vargas Llosa Translated by Edith Grossman 244 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $26.

What to make of the tireless Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, candidate for president of his country in 1990, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2010 and, at age 81, still a vivid presence on the world stage? He is the only surviving member of the so-called ÂBoomÂ generation of Latin American novelists of the 1960s Â an extraordinary group that included Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez of Colombia, Julio CortÃ¡zar of Argentina, JosÃ© Donoso of Chile and Carlos Fuentes of Mexico. Through some rare alchemy of the moment, they managed, as writers, to conjure the Bolivarian ideal of a unified Latin America that the fractious reality of politics could never achieve. Their popularity in Europe and the United States gave millions of Latin Americans the sense that they were part of a borderless, highly original culture that produced more than just caudillos, guerrilleros and boleros. It also paved the way for older writers, like Jorge Luis Borges, and younger ones, like Roberto BolaÃ±o, to gain recognition abroad.

Vargas Llosa is the most overtly political of the Boom writers. His most admired novel, ÂThe War of the End of the WorldÂ (1981), is about a provincial uprising in Brazil in the late 19th century that resulted in the slaughter of more than 15,000 peasants. The novel examines the dangers of utopian fanaticism, as well as the destructiveness of an out-of-touch government that imagines a threat to its existence where there isnÂt one Â a deadly misunderstanding between rulers and the ruled. His other major political novel, ÂFeast of the GoatÂ (2000), is a terrifying study of how a dictator with absolute power (Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic, in this case) can colonize even the intimate lives of his countrymen, stifling the private freedom to enjoy, to appreciate, to reason and, finally, to love.

Vargas Llosa has also had a prolific career as a journalist and public intellectual; ÂSabers and UtopiasÂ is his 25th volume of nonfiction. An absorbing collection of essays and newspaper columns about Latin American politics and culture, it has the feel of a definitive position paper. Written over a period of 35 years, these pieces express, above all, his wish that Latin Americans would finally come to their senses and embrace that most unfairly (in his view) maligned of political doctrines: liberalism.

What he means by liberalism is free elections with no parties excluded, a judiciary independent enough to enforce democratic law over the ambitions of powerful individuals, freedom of expression for both the press and artists, an armed force concerned solely with protecting the country from external threats, equal rights for minorities and open capital markets. His ardent promotion of the last of these principles has earned him the label Âneoliberal,Â a term designed, Vargas Llosa writes, Âto semantically devalue, with the corrosive weapon of derision, the doctrine that symbolizes, better than any other, the extraordinary advances that Â freedom has made over the long course of human civilization.Â

The rudimentary nature of his economic argument has not served him well. He acknowledges the danger Âof powerful multinational companies operating, unrestrained, in all corners of the earth.Â But his antidote is nothing more than a vague endorsement of Âfair laws and strong governments.Â In his previous book of essays, ÂNotes on the Death of Culture,Â he bemoaned rampant consumerism as the death of serious art and thought, yet in ÂSabers and UtopiasÂ he ignores the fact that the lifeblood of giant manufacturers is not the creation of wealth for people who most need it, but cheap labor and ever-expanding markets. His attachment to a pure 18th-century European liberalism sometimes blinds him to present-day realities that must be reckoned with for liberalism to survive.

Still, autonomous liberal democracy has had few chances to thrive in Latin America, and Vargas LlosaÂs passionate belief in it can be persuasive. ItÂs worth pointing out that in the 1960s he was a radical socialist and supporter of Fidel Castro, whom he saw, along with thousands of other intellectuals at the time, as the model for Latin AmericaÂs future. Disillusionment came when Castro suppressed free speech and imprisoned critics, homosexuals and other nonconforming minorities deemed enemies of the revolution. A government-controlled economy that led to decades of stagnation seemed to clinch his conversion. He began to see Castro not as a revolutionary savior, but as one of a long line of dictators from both the left and the right who have kept Latin America in a state of perpetual darkness.

Since then, Vargas LlosaÂs liberalism has been remarkably consistent. Far from being a corporate apologist of the right, as his detractors have branded him, he has encouraged the development of Âa genuinely democraticÂ left in Peru and has strongly supported left-leaning leaders in Chile, Uruguay and Brazil who have attempted to govern Âin the manner of Spanish and British socialists.Â

In 1990, running for president of Peru as a pragmatic, right-of-center liberal, he lost in a runoff to the populist candidate, Alberto Fujimori. At the time, unemployment was over 50 percent and quadruple digit inflation had rendered the currency virtually worthless. The war with the guerrilla group the Shining Path Â which ultimately resulted in the murder, torture and disappearance of more than 69,000 Âpoor and completely innocentÂ Peruvians Â was at its height. During the presidential campaign a guerrilla commando group planned to assassinate Vargas Llosa and his family at an airport but were discovered before they could attack.

As president, Fujimori suspended all civil liberties. In 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for murders carried out by a military death squad while he was in office. Last December, the current Peruvian president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, pardoned Fujimori, now 79, on medical grounds, provoking protests and resignations from members of the government. The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for human rights called it Âa slap in the face for the victimsÂ and Âa major setback for the rule of law in Peru.Â It is enticing to wonder how the country would have fared had Vargas Llosa won the 1990 election.

In ÂSabers and Utopias,Â Vargas Llosa repeatedly returns to what he regards as Latin AmericansÂ chronic weakness for demagogues and phantom utopias. This admirer Â and practitioner Â of magic and illusion in art pleads for bland, mediocre reality in politics. Why must Âwhat is real and possibleÂ be continuously rejected Âin favor of what is imaginary and chimericÂ? His exasperation is almost palpable on the page. It is as old as SimÃ³n BolÃ­varÂs lament, made shortly before he died, in 1830, that ÂAmerica is ungovernable.Â And it echoes the words of his fellow Boom novelist GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez, who in 1999 called Latin America Âa laboratory of failed illusions. Our main virtue is creativity, and yet we have not done much more than live off reheated doctrines and alien wars.Â

Unlike GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez, Vargas Llosa does not resign himself to this state of affairs. The contradiction between Latin AmericaÂs extravagant creativity and its agonies of injustice and poverty can be overcome with sound laws and reasonable democracy, he believes, if only Âpoetic metaphorsÂ are kept out of politics and stay where they belong.

ÂThe Neighborhood,Â Vargas LlosaÂs 20th novel, is a political mystery of the kind he regularly turns out between his more monumental historical productions. The tone, perfectly conveyed in Edith GrossmanÂs virtuoso translation, is amused and theatrical Â realism that never asks the reader to forget it has been neatly contrived.

The subject, however, couldnÂt be more serious. The story takes place in Lima shortly before the downfall of the Fujimori regime in 2000. The cast of characters includes the star reporter of a vile tabloid magazine who is ÂnourishedÂ by Âfinding out other peopleÂs secret shames,Â her flashy, unscrupulous editor, an impoverished old man who worked in show business until the editor destroyed his career and two complacent, upper-class couples who are also best friends. The wives pass the time shopping, decorating and bossing their servants around while secretly conducting a passionate lesbian love affair. The husbands make the money that keeps their bubble from bursting Â one is a lawyer at PeruÂs most prestigious firm; the other owns a mining company and has extensive international connections, as well as an engineering degree from M.I.T. Vargas LlosaÂs portrait of the couples is ambiguous: At one moment they are worldly sophisticates doing their best to operate productively in the political barbarism of Peru; at the next they are vulgar members of an elite for whom Âculture comes down to two words: whiskey and Miami.Â In the background, bombs explode at all hours, guerrillas kidnap businessmen, government death squads murder indiscriminately and workaday life somehow manages to grind on.

The plot slips into gear when the tabloid editor tries to blackmail the mining magnate with explicit photographs from an orgy. Vargas Llosa knows how the levers of power in his country work, and he uses his story to anatomize the degradation of civic life under Fujimori. Vladimiro Montesinos, who was the head of FujimoriÂs secret police, emerges as a character in the novel, buying the support of journalists and opposition leaders with bags of cash and videotaping the bribes from his compound. In these scenes, the novelist need hardly invent a word: The real-life Montesinos is currently serving time for bribery in a maximum-security prison he himself built for his enemies.

To tell his story, Vargas Llosa employs the familiar telenovela technique of alternating chapters among different characters, allowing the destinies of the lowborn and the high, the powerful and the powerless, to intersect in ways they themselves never see. In a diseased body politic, he seems to say, no one is exempt from infection, and the sanity of every citizen is dependent upon that of his neighbor.

The novelÂs hero arises unexpectedly from the lowest depths of the gutter press, Âan inconsequential girl, a nobodyÂ who, Âon the basis of pure courage,Â changes the lives of Peruvians. This seems fitting; those toiling in the muck, without illusions, are best prepared to beat the government at its own game.

The bookÂs ÂhappyÂ ending reflects its authorÂs belief, perhaps, in the power of individual morality and will. In ÂSabers and UtopiasÂ Vargas Llosa approvingly quotes Karl PopperÂs dictum that Âoptimism is a duty. The future is open. Â We all contribute to determining it by what we do.Â His steadfast liberalism in the face of state terror, military dictatorships, violent liberation movements and collapsed economies is his ultimate expression of that duty.
