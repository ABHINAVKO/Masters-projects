Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Senate Democrats looked ready to block a stopgap bill that passed the House late Thursday in a bid to keep much of the government running past midnight tonight.

The Democrats are intent on securing concessions that would, among other things, protect some young immigrants from deportation. We break down the arguments.

The atmosphere has not been helped by a public spat between President Trump and his chief of staff, John Kelly, over the proposed border wall. Our Washington reporters analyze what was perhaps an inevitable clash between two alpha males.

• Driving a car into Manhattan could cost $11.52 as the city looks to become the first in the U.S. to introduce traffic charging.

Trucks and for-hire vehicles would cost more, but major bridges would stay free under a proposal prepared for Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Fees for taxis and for-hire vehicles could be put in place within a year.

New York has resisted pay-to-drive systems in the past, but proponents of the latest plan say it could both ease choked traffic and fund badly needed work on the city’s failing transport infrastructure.

• The Trump administration is said to be pressing forward with plans to transfer the American Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.

Officials had said the move would not happen until the end of President Trump’s term, but now it appears the embassy could relocate as early as next year.

The acceleration suggests the White House no longer cares about cushioning the blow of the new policy, which has cast Mr. Trump’s peacemaking ambitions into doubt.

• The Supreme Court temporarily blocked a redistricting effort in North Carolina, making it likely that the midterm elections will be held using district layouts favorable to Republicans.

Two other tests of gerrymandering are coming, from Wisconsin and Maryland, and they are likely to effectively decide the North Carolina case.

• NASA declared 2017 Earth’s second-warmest year on record. The high temperatures surprised scientists, who had expected a sharper retreat from recent record-breaking years.

Iran is the latest example of a water crisis — whether caused by nature, mismanagement or both. They’re a likely source of future unrest.

The parents accused of holding their 13 children captive in California were formally charged with torture and abuse. They could face life in prison.

The Riverside County district attorney, Mike Hestrin, said it was one of the most horrific cases of “human depravity” he had encountered.

• In today’s show, Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois discusses how President Trump’s racially charged comments led to a showdown over keeping the government open.

• The Times, in other words

Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles.

Long before the world got hooked on “Game of Thrones,” “I Love Lucy” was almost unprecedented in popularity — and daring in content for the time.

Lucy was one of the first pregnant characters shown on U.S. television, and 44 million viewers tuned to CBS 65 years ago today to see Lucille Ball’s character become a mother.

(Lucy gave birth to Ricky on the air the same night that Ms. Ball gave birth to her second child.)

That episode’s audience numbers have since been far surpassed — the Super Bowl, for instance, has drawn more than 100 million viewers for each of the past eight years. But almost 72 percent of TVs in the U.S. were tuned in to “I Love Lucy” that day, an astonishing feat.

According to Nielsen, which tracks viewing behavior, the final episode of “M*A*S*H,” in 1983, had the highest rating of any fictional show in U.S. history, 125 million. But few shows can rival the positive response that the “I Love Lucy” birth episode, and the arrival of Ms. Ball’s second child, elicited.

“One million viewers responded with congratulatory telephone calls, telegrams, letters or gifts,” The Times noted in Ms. Ball’s obituary in 1989.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• It was one of the U.S. intelligence service’s worst failures in years: China dismantled American spying operations and killed or imprisoned more than a dozen C.I.A. informants since 2010.

Now, an American is suspected of having helped Beijing by identifying informants. Jerry Chun Shing Lee, who left the C.I.A. in 2007, was apprehended at Kennedy Airport this week. Read the affidavit supporting charges against him.

• Officials are concerned that the case could represent a pattern of Chinese intelligence targeting former agency employees.

• Republicans hoping to stave off a government shutdown this weekend are pairing a stopgap spending measure with long-term funding for the popular Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, effectively daring Democrats to vote no.

The bill would not address the future of the so-called Dreamers, the hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.

• But it would provide CHIP, which covers nearly nine million children, with funding for six years.

• A Pentagon plan that has been sent to President Trump for approval would permit the use of nuclear weapons to respond to a wide range of devastating but non-nuclear assaults, including cyberattacks.

The document casts a bleak picture of U.S. national security threats, citing not only Russian and Chinese nuclear advances but also ones by North Korea and, potentially, Iran.

• Separately, Japan’s public broadcaster accidentally sent news alerts on Tuesday that North Korea had launched a missile — just days after the government of Hawaii sent a similar warning.

• North and South Korea agreed today to field a joint women’s ice hockey team at the Winter Olympics next month, and to have their athletes march under one flag at the opening ceremony.

The Games, which begin on Feb. 9 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, will be the first time the countries have a joint Olympic team.

Seoul has said in the past that it hoped such a move could contribute to a political thaw after years of high tensions.

• The house near Los Angeles where 13 siblings, some shackled and emaciated, were held captive by their parents was also being used as a state-approved school.

The case raises questions about whether California is too lenient in its approach to home schooling, and whether it should have been monitoring David Turpin, the father and supposed principal, more closely.

• The parents, both arrested on nine counts of torture and child endangerment, remain in jail.

• The White House physician said on Tuesday that President Trump’s overall health was “excellent,” and that the president had received a perfect score on a test to screen for neurological impairment.

The physician, Dr. Ronny Jackson, said that Mr. Trump, 71, had asked for the cognitive test to try to quell questions about his mental abilities.

• Dr. Jackson also said that the president weighed 239 pounds and was too sedentary.

• President Trump’s former chief strategist was subpoenaed last week by the special counsel to testify before a grand jury as part of the investigation into possible links between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia.

It is the first time Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor, is known to have used a grand jury subpoena to seek information from a member of the president’s inner circle.

• But it could be just a negotiating tactic, our reporter notes, and doesn’t mean Mr. Bannon is the focus of the inquiry.

• Americans are warming to the Republican tax law and are increasingly confident in the economy, according to a new poll. They just aren’t sure that President Trump deserves much credit.

• Twenty-one states have filed a suit against the Federal Communications Commission, saying the agency’s recent repeal of so-called net neutrality rules was “arbitrary and capricious.”

• It’s time for Apple to build a less-addictive iPhone, our technology columnist writes.

• U.S. stocks were down on Tuesday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today.

Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.

• You’ve been asked to be a bridesmaid. Now what?

• Observing “dry January”? Here are six alcohol-free cocktails.

A new generation of cooks and scholars is reclaiming and spreading the cuisine of the country’s indigenous people.

• Philip Roth still has plenty to say

In an interview with The Times, the (former) novelist recalls his 50-plus years as a writer: “Exhilaration and groaning. Frustration and freedom. Inspiration and uncertainty. Abundance and emptiness. Blazing forth and muddling through.”

• Best of late-night TV

The comedy hosts were surprised by the results of President Trump’s physical exam.

• Quotation of the day

“We talked about diet and exercise a lot. He’s more enthusiastic about the diet part than the exercise part, but we’re going to do both.”

— Dr. Ronny Jackson, the White House physician, on President Trump.

• The Times, in other words

Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles.

“Color,” said Louis Comfort Tiffany, “is to the eye what music is to the ear.”

Tiffany, who died on this day 85 years ago, was the son of the founder of Tiffany & Co., the famous jeweler. But the younger Tiffany found his own success as an artist and designer, most famous for his work with stained glass.

In 1881, he helped redesign the interior of a house in Hartford, Conn., owned by Mark Twain, who was making his name after the publication of “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.”

The work was followed a year later by a commission with a much higher profile: redecorating the White House.

Chester Arthur had been thrust into office after the assassination of President James Garfield in 1881. He hired Tiffany to remodel the Executive Mansion to suit his refined tastes.

Tiffany redecorated several rooms, and he also installed a large stained-glass screen in the Entrance Hall.

But his mark on the White House did not last. Twenty years later, in 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered a major renovation that swept away the building’s Victorian touches — including Tiffany’s screen.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• A plan to create a new American-backed, Kurdish-led border force in northeastern Syria could also ignite a new phase in the country’s civil war that would pit American allies against one another.

Turkey, a NATO ally of the U.S., has threatened to invade a Syrian Kurdish enclave, called Afrin, as soon as today. The Syrian government, Russia, Iran and most Syrian opposition groups also object to any division of the country.

Separately, the Trump administration is withholding more than half of its funding to a United Nations agency that aids Palestinian refugees, arguing that the decision was intended to encourage other countries to increase aid.

_____

• Oliver Ivanovic, a prominent Serb politician in Kosovo, was shot and killed, heightening tensions between Kosovo and Serbia, which refuses to recognize Kosovo’s independence.

Mr. Ivanovic faced war-crimes charges, which he described as politically motivated, but he was also a rare voice for the coexistence of ethnic Albanians and Serbs.

Above, a memorial outside his home in Mitrovica.

_____

• “Under no circumstances will we allow the Jungle to come back.”

That was President Emmanuel Macron of France speaking in Calais in reference to a migrant settlement there that was dismantled in 2016. Mr. Macron visited the port city to defend his immigration policies against critics who have accused him of inhumanity.

Meanwhile, the number of new asylum seekers arriving in Germany continues to fall sharply.

_____

• In Chile, Pope Francis said he was “pained and ashamed” over the “irreparable damage” priests had inflicted on minors, as he offered an apology during his first visit to their country as pontiff.

The speech was interrupted by bursts of applause, but he later drew criticism for celebrating Mass alongside a bishop who has been accused of protecting an abusive priest.

Meanwhile in Ireland, the last of the infamous church-run Magdalene Laundries for “fallen women” could soon be razed. Some want to save the Dublin building to serve as a memorial to those who suffered.

_____

• Stephen Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, has been called to testify before a grand jury — the latest twist in the investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election.

Separately, Mr. Trump’s overall health was “excellent,” the White House physician said. But the president’s weight is 108 kilograms and, according to the doctor, he does not get enough exercise.

“I’ve found no reason whatsoever to think the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought processes,” the physician said.

Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. Republicans are getting closer to victory on a tax bill.

Senators Marco Rubio and Bob Corker said they’ll support the $1.5 trillion tax cut, and a vote is planned for next week. Negotiators agreed to provide a more generous child tax credit in the final bill to shore up support from Mr. Rubio, above.

It’s still unclear how Republicans are going to pay for the entire package, which can add no more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit in order to pass without Democrat support. Lobbyists were playing hardball during the frantic negotiations.

_____

2. President Trump attended an F.B.I. Academy ceremony to honor local police officers and sheriffs who had received specialized training.

On his way there, he escalated his attacks on the agency over its investigation of possible links between Russia and his campaign. “It’s a shame what’s happened with the F.B.I.,” he told reporters.

At the event, he sat next to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray, to his right in the photo above, and did not repeat his criticisms.

_____

3. There he is, Ajit Pai, the head of the Federal Communications Commission, as you’ve never seen him before.

In a video released this week by a conservative website, Mr. Pai made an argument for repealing net neutrality rules in the silliest ways possible. (Not pictured: him dancing the Harlem Shake.)

The agency did, of course, vote to repeal those rules on Thursday. Here’s some of the best writing from across the political spectrum on the vote.

_____

4. There’s upheaval inside the G.O.P. after Roy Moore’s defeat in Alabama this week.

Establishment Republicans are trying to kneecap Stephen Bannon, above, and dry up his funding. He counters that he’s playing a long game. “Revolutions and civil wars take a long time,” he told us in an interview.

It seemed impossible a year ago, but it now looks like the Democrats could take back the Senate in 2018. Some Democrats argue that Alabama shows why they should direct resources to communities of color to do that.

_____

5. The New York Police Department is looking into allegations of rape against the hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons. A law enforcement official said that the department was conducting a preliminary investigation and was eager to hear from victims.

Mr. Simmons denies the accusations. And some of the alleged incidents occurred before New York State got rid of its statute of limitations on rape in 2006.

_____

6. Three days after offering to talk to North Korea “without precondition,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reversed course.

Speaking at a U.N. Security Council meeting, he insisted — as President Trump has all along — that the North must stop its nuclear threats and “earn its way” to negotiations.

The North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, celebrates the “rocket men” building his nuclear missile as national heroes. Here’s what we know about them.

_____

7. Three weeks after the 37-year rule of Robert Mugabe came to an end, Zimbabwe’s new leaders are moving to improve economic relations with the West.

“We call for the unconditional lifting of the political and economic sanctions, which have crippled our national development,” said the new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, above.

Opposition parties and human rights groups say that despite Mr. Mnangagwa’s promises of a new Zimbabwe, he has hewed to his predecessor’s strategies.

_____

8. A friendly reminder from Jimmy Kimmel: “Christmas is 10 days away, which means we only get to hear that Mariah Carey song 75,000 more times.”

Our business desk delved into the economics of Christmas celebrations, following one Christmas tree from a farm in Nova Scotia to a cozy living room in Queens. If the U.S. withdraws from Nafta, the price of that tree would probably jump.

_____

9. On that note, may we present (pun alert) our 2017 Gift Guide, created with our product-review site Wirecutter.

Among the editors’ picks: the photo book “Barbra,” an affordable robot vacuum and a coffee maker that our team crowned No. 1 after hundreds of test cups.

_____

10. Finally, back by popular demand: The Week in Good News.

After the column debuted last week, many readers wrote in to express their appreciation. “Such a breath of fresh air to all the chaos going on in the world right now,” one wrote.

This week’s selections: Auntie Caterina, above, who gives free taxi rides to the hospital for children with cancer; a huge opportunity for a young actor in London; and a trip to China’s Florida, complete with sun, sand and retired snowbirds.

Have a great weekend.

Investors have spent the last year telling Google to stop opening its wallet so much. On Thursday, they got their wish.

In the first earnings report for Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer Google lured from Morgan Stanley, Ms. Porat said the company was keeping a closer eye on costs. The numbers backed her up, with revenue and profits outpacing the expectations of Wall Street.

The slower growth in costs, along with suggestions from Ms. Porat that Google will try to be more forthcoming with investors — and may be open to redistributing some of the company’s cash pile down the line — suggested a new era of cooperation from a company that has historically had an antagonistic relationship with Wall Street.

“She confirmed that they are more open to focusing on expense controls, more open to providing new disclosures and more open to potentially returning cash,” said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Securities. “Those are the three things people wanted, and she came through.”

Ms. Porat has been on the job since May, so she had little if any impact on the company’s second-quarter results. Still, analysts like Mr. Schachter were impressed by her investor-friendly tone, and Google shares jumped nearly 11 percent in after-hours trading.

Google remains a fast-growing company, and Ms. Porat said the goal remained to increase revenue. The company continues to hire and spend at a fast clip — just not quite as fast as in past years. And the company has not suggested any less desire for big and ambitious projects.

In a conference call with investors, Ms. Porat used words like “prioritize” and “judiciously” to suggest that it will pursue those projects with an eye on the bottom line.

“How we prioritize and focus on these opportunities remains paramount,” she said, “both for our employees who remain inspired by the opportunity to work on the most cutting-edge developments with maximum global impact and for our shareholders.”

The company reported that revenue rose 11 percent to $17.7 billion from a year earlier, with net revenue — a figure that excludes payments to advertising partners — increasing to $14.35 billion. That was above the $14.28 billion projected by analysts, according to Bloomberg. Google said that absent currency fluctuations, overall revenue would have risen 18 percent from a year ago.

“Our strong Q2 results reflect continued growth across the breadth of our products, most notably core search, where mobile stood out, as well as YouTube and programmatic advertising,” Ms. Porat said.

From self-driving cars to high-tech threads that can be woven into computer clothes, Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., spends a lot of money on some unconventional ideas. The company has defended this as a sign of optimism, both in its core search advertising business — which requires huge sums for things like data centers — as well as future opportunities.

That continued in the second quarter. Google spent $2.8 billion, or 16 percent of its revenue, on research and development, compared with 14 percent a year ago. But it was more cost-conscious than in the past.

This started with Patrick Pichette, Ms. Porat’s predecessor, who had begun peppering the company’s earnings calls with the word “discipline” and highlighted its decision to re-evaluate Google Glass, the company’s much-ridiculed Internet-connected glasses, as an example of this attitude.

On Thursday, Ms. Porat signaled that investors could expect more of the same. “We’re just beginning the 2016 budget process, and core to that is prioritization,” she said in a conference call with analysts.

She also seemed to suggest that Google would try to be more open with investors about how the company’s business was changing. Google, like every technology company, is seeing a rapid evolution of its business as people spend more time with mobile phones. In many places, including the United States, Google searches on mobile devices now outnumber those on desktop and laptop computers.

That has led to a long-run decline in “cost per click,” which is how much the company is paid, on average, each time someone clicks on an ad. The measure has fallen over the past few years, but on Thursday, Ms. Porat said the gap between desktop and mobile was closing, as mobile prices rise and desktop prices remain steady.

Analysts are starving for specifics about what exactly is driving this and what it means about Google’s core search business and growing areas like YouTube. During the call, one analyst asked if more specific disclosures would be coming in the months and years ahead. Ms. Porat did not make any commitments, but said: “I am trying to create a framework that helps you understand where we’re going.” 

Google’s cash pile swelled to $70 billion in the second quarter. Investors have spent most of the past year asking Google to lay out a plan for if and how it might return some of that money to shareholders — such as by issuing a dividend or buying back stock — and that continued on Thursday.

Ms. Porat was noncommittal but did not say no. No doubt the bulk of that money will be put toward addressing the company’s many challenges — including those from a host of new mobile search competitors including Apple, European regulators that have accused the company of abusive and monopolistic practices, and its expensive and long-running quest to create revolutionary new businesses in areas like self-driving cars.

But for the moment, at least, the company’s relationship with Wall Street seems to be off the problem list.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• A government shutdown, which could come at the end of this week, would bring unknown consequences for lawmakers in both parties. We clarify what’s at stake.

Some Democrats insist that any bill to fund the government must also protect the 800,000 young immigrants known as Dreamers. But 10 Democratic senators are up for re-election this fall in states with little sympathy for undocumented immigrants.

Republicans face their own uncertainties: “To believe that you can successfully blame Democrats for a shutdown over the DACA debate is naïve,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects Dreamers.

• The debate has been complicated by President Trump’s inflammatory remarks last week about immigrants from Haiti and Africa. Describing talks with African officials, a former U.S. ambassador said, “The appropriate word to describe their reactions to the president’s comments is fury.”

• Stephen Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, has been called to testify before a grand jury as part of the special counsel’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. He is the first member of Mr. Trump’s inner circle known to have received a grand jury subpoena.

• Robert Mueller issued the subpoena after Mr. Bannon was quoted in a new book criticizing Mr. Trump, and saying that Donald Trump Jr.’s 2016 meeting with Russians was “treasonous.”

• The most significant attempt yet to loosen regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis is being led by the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers — with the help of some Senate Democrats.

Allowing hundreds of smaller banks to avoid certain federal oversight, the bill would revise the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which President Trump has called “a disaster.”

• The legislation — which critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, say goes too far — is expected to go to the Senate floor in the coming month.

• As the anniversary of the demonstrations that drew hundreds of thousands approaches, a rift has developed between two groups trying to continue the activism the movement inspired.

On one side, Women’s March Inc., which organized the event in Washington and spent much of the past year coordinating protests.

On the other, the organization March On, which says that winning elections should be the primary goal.

• “We can march and take to the streets and yell about all the stuff we want to change, but unless we’re getting people elected to office who are going to make those changes, we’re not really doing anything,” a March On board member said.

• A 17-year-old girl held captive by her parents escaped from her home near Los Angeles on Sunday and called the police, who rescued 12 of her brothers and sisters, some shackled to their beds.

The officers did not immediately realize that seven of the 13 siblings were adults because they were emaciated. They range in age from 2 to 29.

• The parents were arrested on nine counts each of torture and child endangerment.

• The language of Kazakhstan is written in a version of Cyrillic, a legacy of Soviet rule. But the country is moving to a script based on the Latin alphabet.

The challenge: writing down a tongue that has no alphabet of its own. The solution, according to the country’s first and only president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, is lots and lots of apostrophes.

(The Republic of Kazakhstan, for example, will be written Qazaqstan Respy’bli’kasy.)

• In a country where almost nobody challenges the president publicly, the apostrophe plan has been criticized from all sides. The script “makes your eyes hurt,” one professor said.

• The recent raids on 7-Eleven stores show the price of employing workers illegally, the Trump administration says.

But the message is felt more by workers than by their employers.

• Alexa, earn your keep. Many people use digital assistants to get the weather forecast or listen to music. That’s a long way from the digital home that tech giants envisioned.

• And you thought today’s news was busy

Fifty years ago, the world was in a tumult and seemed to be at a crossroads.

We looked back at 1968 and imagined the flurry of news alerts that would have sent smartphones vibrating (had they existed).

• In defense of Aziz Ansari

A Times Op-Ed says that an essay accusing the actor and comedian of sexually inappropriate conduct is “arguably the worst thing that has happened to the #MeToo movement.”

• In memoriam

Dolores O’Riordan, the lead singer of the Irish band the Cranberries, lent an unmistakable sound to their alternative rock hits in the 1990s, including “Linger” and “Zombie.” She was 46.

• Best of late-night TV

“[Expletive]-hole”? “[Expletive]-house”? Who cares?

• Quotation of the day

“The reality is, he made a fairly simple mistake, and no one wants to ruin someone’s life because he made a simple mistake. If his identity was out there, he’d be a pariah.”

— Richard Rapoza, of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, on an employee who set off a false alarm about an incoming missile.

• The Times, in other words

Here’s an image of today’s front page, and a link to the crossword puzzles.

The event 80 years ago today would be, The Times announced at the time, the first swing concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City. Benny Goodman, the jazz clarinetist, would perform.

“The event will be decisive in the history of swing,” a Times writer declared. “What will it sound like in this strange milieu of righteousness and uplift, and what will be its effect on swing?”

Fans of swing expressed concern that exposure to New York’s elite would eventually rob the grass-roots genre of its “elusiveness, its absolute freedom from technique or rules.”

Those fears were dispelled by Mr. Goodman’s success in captivating the crowd.

Carnegie Hall “had never seen an audience that behaved this way: listeners who not only listened but swayed to the music, made sounds and seemed ready to break into some kind of hysterical dance,” The Times reported.

Our critic found the music liberating in a dark era of totalitarian ideologies. “It is not so much a doctrine set to music as it is a revolt against doctrine.”

“If the individual has his unhampered say in music, he may manage to have it in other fields,” he wrote. “Dictators should be suspicious of swing.”
